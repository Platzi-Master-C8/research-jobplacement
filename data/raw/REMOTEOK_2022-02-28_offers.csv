Building owners work tirelessly to bring on new, creative developments into cities that enable people to explore the area in a unique way and feel inspired while doing so. Developing buildings is high risk, and Barsala increases the chances that the building owner will make a return on their investment by monetizing their vacant apartments.\\n\\nTravelers have evolved over time. Hotels aren't friendly for those staying for extended periods of time, and other rental options has a lack of consistency that leaves the traveler wondering if the owner will accidentally open the door to their room.\\n\\nBarsala offers fully furnished, livable spaces for remote workers, business travelers, digital nomads, and anyone else who is looking for a better way to stay. These come equipped with a washer/dryer and kitchen, and they provide unique opportunities for people to explore new cities.\\n\\n**About the Role**\\n\\nBarsala is looking for a product-focused engineer that can implement creative solutions across a variety of products, and build world class technology for our guests and building partners.\\n\\n**What You'll Do:**\\n\\n* Build key components of the Barsala platform: \\n * A world-class hotel suite of guest applications that empowers them to take full advantage of their stays\\n * Includes our web platform, mobile app, checkin form, and the API that powers all of them\\n * Smart home and building IoT integrations for a next generation hospitality experience\\n * Identity verification and improvements to our fraud detection services\\n * Applications for our building owners to help manage and improve their experience with Barsala\\n* Collaborate with stakeholders across the world to drive teams towards high impact\\n* Help us grow our new team by interviewing and recruiting new engineers\\n* Develop a culture of high ownership, innovation, empathy, and collaboration\\n* Make investments in engineering reliability, productivity, and excellence\\n\\n**Why you might be excited about us**\\n* We’re building the future of travel. We’re a passionate team of individuals that love to travel and explore new cities, and we take that energy into building an experience that’s unlike what exists today 😎\\n* You’ll work closely and communicate directly with product owners at Barsala and work with them to build the right solutions to the problems they face\\n* You'll quickly have responsibility over big areas of our products.\\n* The future is very bright - we’ve bootstrapped the company to ~1,000 properties across 12 different cities. We've recently raised a round of funding and are looking to accelerate this growth in 2022! 🚀\\n\\n**Why you might not be excited about us**\\n* We're a relatively small team, so if you like more established teams, it's not (yet) the right time. You'll help build our company's culture.\\n* Since we're still a startup, projects and priorities may shift.\\n* Since you'll have a lot of responsibility and creativity over projects, they may not be defined perfectly initially. You'll be expected to bring your own experience and perspective to help us do the right things, and raise flags if you think we should do things differently.\\n\\n**About you**\\n* Minimum 4 years of experience designing, building, enterprise-grade or consumer-facing software \\n* Strong proficiency in Node, React and React Native, and preferably Next.js\\n* Experience or confidence in their ability to lead teams to accomplish projects end to end\\n* Detail-oriented, has a muscle for making trade-offs between technical perfection and time to go live\\n* Strong communication skills and comfortable collaborating with non-technical stakeholders\\n* Successful track record in challenging engineering roles within startups\\n* Comfortable establishing standards in codebases for others to follow\\n\\n**Why Barsala?**\\n* Annual credits and discounted rates to Barsala properties ✈️\\n* WeWork membership reimbursement\\n* Professional development reimbursement\\n* Home office & technology reimbursement\\n* Remote work opportunities\\n* Opportunity to:\\n * Grow as a technical leader within our engineering team, getting experience coordinating with other engineers and mentoring them\\n * Gain technical ownership over numerous products \\n* Exact title flexible based on level of experience\\n* We provide medical, dental and vision insurance \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **GLOWING** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Would you like to work within a compact, super-capable team in a refreshing work environment? Would you like to work on an application that is changing the way we learn and communicate? Drops could be the place for you.\\n\\nAbout us:\\n\\nOur goal at Drops is to ensure effective language learning through a delightful, seamless, gamified experience. We strive to be the #1 app for vocabulary learning. Our app has been live on the App Store for 4 years, covering 42 languages, serving over 27 million users across the globe and has been featured on both the App Store (App of the Day) and Play Store (App of the Year in 2018). Drops has also been featured by TechCrunch, FastCo, Forbes, CNN, Bloomberg, VentureBeat and many, many more. In short, we’re a tiny but very powerful team spread (mostly) across Europe, achieving great things the remote way! In December 2020, Drops was acquired by Kahoot!, the world’s leading game-based learning platform\\n\\nCheck us out here: https://languagedrops.com\\n\\n\\nAbout you:\\n\\nYou’re a no-nonsense person, comfortable taking on a variety of projects who has been working within product companies and has extensive front-end development experience.\\n\\nYou’ve spent years working with React and have experience in React Native with a deep understanding of the internal workings be it working within the browser or a mobile client. You enjoy the challenge of growing a product from an (already) large user base to a larger one with tens of millions of MAU with all the complexities it comes with.\\n\\nYou are an advocate for static typing and prefer to use a minimal set of simple tools over a diverse range of complex ones.\\n\\nYou believe variety is the spice of life - In this role, you’ll be developing a complex app deployable to web and app stores, a static site generator, building internal automation infrastructure/tooling and contributing to our internal CMS. You could also be working on our fully serverless architecture on the backend if you feel comfortable doing so.\\n\\nDrops is a deliberately small, but super effective team. You’re naturally drawn to the fate of the products & driven to grow as an engineer rather than to manage people.\\n\\n\\nThe role:\\nYou’ll be a core part of the development team, working on both our main (Drops) and auxiliary products (Droplets, Visual Dictionary, Internal CMS tooling). Drops values clear, honest communication and transparency. It’s the linchpin of our culture, success and freedom. You’ll be involved in both high and low level decision making and are available during European working hours (10AM - 6PM CET). Remember, we’re looking for a missionary here rather than a mercenary.\\n\\n\\nYou will:\\n* Work cross functionally with our lead designer / data analyst / engineers / project owner to define, scope, estimate and plan various aspects of the product.\\n* Work independently (and with other engineers!) to develop new web experiences\\n* Support of production applications / sites that you’ve built or helped to build\\n* Communicate effectively and often to ensure that everyone is aligned\\n\\n\\nWhat’d be different here:\\n* We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity\\n* We’re using a single programming language - TypeScript. We have strict linter rules Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow and we release a few times a week\\n* We’re using React + Redux to develop UI, on both mobile and the web. We use selectors extensively. Our backend is on AWS, deployed multi-region to Lambda and using RDS for our DB\\n* We are BIG on AB testing. We focus on releasing high impact projects and minimise noise\\n* We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit. We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web\\n* We automate where it has positive ROI\\n* Our biggest challenge is (and will remain) managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps\\n\\n\\nRequirements:\\n* At least 5 years of experience in software (product) development\\n* At least 2 years of experience in building apps with React or React Native with state management tools (redux, flux, etc)\\n* Experience architecting and developing complex web or mobile apps and static sites\\n* Some experience in understanding basic user funnels, and collaborating with support to resolve user-facing issues\\n* Project management experience (everyone manages projects at Drops)\\n* Strong verbal and written communication skills\\n* The ability to work well cross-functionally\\n* Experienced in strongly typed languages\\n\\n\\nBenefits:\\n🌍 All the perks of remote working\\n👥 An awesomely compact 20 person team\\n🧠 Yearly educational allowance\\n💪 Fitness allowance\\n💻 High-end Apple hardware and ergonomic accessories\\n🏖 36 days of holiday per year\\n✈️ Quarterly team gathering somewhere in the world (Amsterdam, Iceland, Lisbon and Budapest were previous locations) \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **RELIEF** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

So if this role resonates with you, hit that apply button!\\n\\nThe Role:\\n\\nWe are looking for a Senior Lead Designer/ Associate Creative Director who strives to build award winning digital experiences.\xa0You are a multifaceted creative. One who can perfectly balance conceptual with practical and know when to turn up the volume of either depending on the project. You understand that rules are helpful and how to work in them.

You will be working together with various members and teams to achieve your goals - You’ll not only investigate how we currently work and help us optimise it as you grow into your role, but will also help push our brand to a new level and deliver best in class creative. We’re just getting started, so joining us now means a LOT of influence on the direction we’re going.\\n\\nLeading in your role isn\'t working on your own, though - you’ll have peers, leaders and mentors available to help when needed as you innovate your way to delivering results and supporting others.\xa0\\n\\nIn this role you will lead our Studio team and will use your knowledge to help invent, solve and simplify all of our design decisions. You will have a hybrid range of skills and you will understand large-scale, cross- organisational workflows and projects and work with the team to design world class digital experiences.\\n\\nThis role can be based anywhere in Australia. Our head office is in Melbourne, and we also have a Sydney office, so you can do fully remote or a mix of both if in those cities.\\n\\n\\nWhere & How We Work\\n\\nWe are a global, diverse group across age, gender, and race and offer a truly flexible and family friendly work environment. Kids, pets, and the occasional delivery person are all actively encouraged to appear on our Zoom screens. All of us at Linktree work either fully remote or a hybrid ""remote, but in-office sometimes"" approach and that will continue even when COVID is behind us.\\n\\nWe currently have offices in Melbourne, Sydney, LA coming next, but our team is spread across Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, USA, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand.\\n\\nBeing globally distributed doesn\'t mean working to one timezone and we offer autonomy and flexibility in how you structure your days and weeks. There will be the need for some collaboration outside of a ""normal"" 9-5 being a global company, but we aim to work asynchronously where possible.\\n\\n\\nOur Culture & Benefits\\n\\nLinktree\'s company culture and values are based around collaboration, diversity, inclusion, and flexibility. Those are all nice words but to give you some more specific examples:\\n\\n- We recognise that each person is unique and have designed our benefits with this in mind. Each person has $6000 AUD to spend across Wellness, Growth, Lifestyle, and Impact pillars. This could be gym memberships, courses, childcare, pet insurance, holidays, or green energy initiatives. \\n\\n- We have a paid 18-week\xa0parental leave program\xa0that is inclusive of birth and non-birthing parents and supports the whole parenting lifecycle.\\n\\n- We are proud to offer all regular full-time and part-time employees 20 hours\' paid volunteering leave per calendar year.\\n\\n- Flexibility is at the core of Linktree, so whether you prefer fully remote, the office, or a bit of both, the choice is up to you. We trust you to get the work done.\\n\\n- We have several diversity and inclusion initiatives underway, including a D&I council, training for all staff on neurodiversity, unconscious bias, and the incorporation of a transpositive inclusion policy.\\n\\n- We prioritise our team\'s mental health, with all employees having free access to Headspace and\xa0Uprise, including 1:1 coaching sessions from qualified psychologists or counsellors.\\n\\n- All Linktree staff receive $1000 AUD towards setting up their work from home space.\\n\\n\\nThe Linktree Story\\n\\nThe average number of social media accounts is close to 9 per person these days. Chances are you’re also using more than 3-4 social media platforms - but where should someone who want to discover more about you can achieve that? In a highly fragmented digital world, the concept of presenting your whole self feels overwhelming to most - and that’s where Linktree comes in.\\n\\nCreating this category 5 years ago, we launched a simple tool that allowed anyone to manage their corner of the online world. Want to link all your social media accounts under one link? Thinking of turning your passion into your income? Want to share your ideas, beliefs, or even just a playlist you like? Linktree has the platform to help you get it done.\\n\\nIt sounds good, we hear you say, but how do I know if it works? Fair question - why don’t you take it up with Facebook, TikTok, Redbull, HBO, Metallica, Alicia Keys, Selena Gomez, or Michelle Obama? They’re all using Linktree!\\n\\nWith an average sign up rate of 30,000+ new users per day for the past 18 months (with no signs of stopping), and with our latest funding round of $45M USD announced recently, we’re on our way to make real impact on the digital world - and we’d love for you to join us for this ride. \\n\\n#Salary and compensation\\n\nNo salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Executive and Executive jobs that are similar:\\n\\n\n$70,000 — $100,000/year\\n\n\\n\\n#Location\\nAnywhere in Australia\n\n\n\n\nSee more jobs at Linktree']",['exec'],https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK

However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.\\n\\nOne of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our first product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible with minimal engineering overhead to both humans and machine-learning models in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.\\n\\nWe\\n\xa0- are allergic to over-engineering.\\n\xa0- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.\\n\xa0- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”.

You should have a good understanding of web and backend technologies and the different challenges of creating web applications backed by REST APIs that are cloud native, having previously developed applications in the public cloud (AWS preferably).\\n\\nWe expect a strong intimacy with JavaScript, as our application runs mainly in React, Redux and Typescript, and Java, as most of our backend stack is written in this language. We also look for proficient knowledge of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, to tune and shape the best data structures for each particular use case. Another important point is having familiarity with REST APIs and a good understanding of backwards compatibility for public APIs. \\n\\nThe list above is quite comprehensive and can be intimidating, but we don’t expect you to be familiar with our whole tech stack coming in. That said, you need to have a willingness to learn as you go, as we believe in a growing and learning mindset, where developers are ready to face new challenges, and learn new technologies when needed. Thus, having the right skills and a positive attitude to learning, is more important for us than the degree. A BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related subject is relevant, as we value an understanding of the fundamentals, but it’s not a prerequisite.\\n\\nWe define ourselves as an agile company, so being open for feedback and adapting to change is core to being a good fit to our team.

Another core belief is that our customers should have full control over their data: all data that goes in, can also be exported out.\\n\\nWe value quality of the code and the product by working as a tight and effective distributed development team, preferably asynchronously, often sharing screens to collaborate. Catenda has offices in Oslo and Bergen, composed by an international team of 10+ nationalities working remotely across the EU.\\n\\nOur solution, Bimsync, is a cloud-based collaboration platform, consisting of a web application, a mobile application and our APIs.
