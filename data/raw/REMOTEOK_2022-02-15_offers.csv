Headquartered in Sacramento, California, we have since grown out of our previous 3 offices and many of our close to 180 employees are spread all across the United States. Those 180 employees support close to 300,000 users across 5,000 offices nationwide and now in Canada as well. Included in that is 8 out of the 15 largest Real Estate Brokerages in the nation.\\n\\nBut, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. All of the growth and success that has happened is a result of us obsessing over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. We know this only happens by hiring people who don’t just come up with out of the box ideas but hiring people who actually see those ideas through and bring them to life. As we’ve grown, we’ve been fortunate enough to hire plenty of people who possess that quality and realize it’s equally important to hire people who can pair that skill with empathy, collaboration, and a keen sense of urgency. If you’re looking to join a company where you can have real impact and surround yourself with an incredible team of people then look no further.\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\\n\\nSKYSLOPE’S CORE VALUES 💪🏻\\nThese are the principles that helped us get to where we are and they are the principles that will guide us to where we want to go in the future.

Then, we introduced MainStreet Procurement, simplifying expense management and contract negotiation for teams without the means to do it themselves.

From complex government tax credits to exclusive discounts on the tools you use every day, we save you thousands of dollars, hundreds of hours, and countless headaches.\\n\\nThroughout the year, you’ll track expenses and savings through your MainStreet dashboard and tag us in on big purchases and contract negotiations. Come tax season, we’ll do the paperwork and even let your CPA take all the credit. Consider us your silent partner-in-savings, your financial secret weapon, your smart (not a) bank – whatever you want to call us. We’ve got your back so you can get back to building your business. ✨\\n\\nOur $60M Series A\\nWe’ve raised over $60M from an incredible community of partners, operators, and founders, including SignalFire (who led our Series A), Ryan Hoover (Product Hunt founder), Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Des Traynor (Intercom co-founder), Gradient Ventures (a Google Venture Fund), Ron Conway’s fund SV Angel, Shrug Capital, and Tusk Ventures.\\n\\nHow we think about diversity\\n\\nWe try to make sure the diversity of our customers is reflected in the team that serves them.

Today we are a team of around 100 amazing people advancing one of the hottest scale-up companies in the cybersecurity awareness training category, with locations in the United States, Finland and the United Kingdom. Hoxhunt is the fastest-growing software company in Finland, premiering at number 4 in the Deloitte Fast 50 rankings so we might just be the perfect choice for You! \\n\xa0\\nHoxhunt educates employees on how to protect themselves and their employers against malicious cyberattacks. Our core belief is that the best way to do this is through frequent, personalized, and behavior-changing cybersecurity training. We have been featured in CIO Magazine, Forbes, Inc., EU-Startups, and many more publications. We have also been listed as one of the 10 hottest startups to work for in 2019 and developer students’ Top 10 Dream Employer in 2021 in Finland.\\n\\n\\nWe are now looking for a\xa0Senior Digital Product Designer to join our Helsinki-based Design Team. You will be a member of the Product Design Team, and closely collaborate with Product Managers and our experienced Developers to create new experiences for our users, and value for our customers. \\n\\nWe’ve created a unique twist to our training. Our platform is “serious gaming”: part game, part education, part simulation. This unique combination makes Hoxhunt a training platform our users love to engage with.\\n\\nBut it also brings with it a tough set of design challenges that we hope you can help us with. For example:\\n- how do we onboard new users, and help them quickly learn the basics?\\n- how do we keep the training fresh and interesting for experienced users?\\n- how can we turn data into useful report for our customers, for example about their risk levels?\\n- how de we provide better self-service tools for our customers to manage and customise the training?\\n- how do we better integrate with the other e-learning solutions our customers are using?\\n\\nYour key responsibilities will include\\n- Gather input and ideas from colleagues and customers: what’s working well, what isn’t?\\n- Work closely together with the product manager to define problems-worth-solving\\n- Collaborate with a wide range of people to explore and sketch out potential UX concepts, and reach agreement on which concept to go for\\n- Create high-fidelity UI designs and clickable mockups. Validate and iterate them.\\n- Work in lock-step with the (frond-end) Devs so that every month the team can ship solutions we are immensely proud of\\n- Expand the UI design toolkit and Design System\\n\xa0\\nWhat you will need as a Sr. Digital Product Designer\\n- You have the ability to dive into an old problem or a new opportunity, and use a range of design methods to get to a workable design solution quickly\\n- Along the way, you bring people together that can help find that solution, and make it happen. When you need someone to bounce off ideas with, you pro-actively reach out to them\\n- You enjoy bringing in other people’s input for the design, organising reviews and managing the feedback. It’s a plus if you have experience running user research sessions\\n- You have a great skillset when it comes to interaction and visual design\\n- You are proficient in Figma (which is what we use) or similar tools\\n- You look forward to working in a Design Team that is small but will likely be growing. You want to contribute to its development (coaching each other, expanding the Design System, improving our methodologies, etc.)\\n- You have a strong track record in designing digital products\\n- You are fluent in English\\n\\nKeen to see our design? Please feel free to take a look into our Dibbble-account https://dribbble.com/Hoxhunt or try out our demo at https://demo.hoxhunt.com\\n\\nIf you have an up-to-date design portfolio, we’d love to see it. We expect it can give us a first impression of how you approach design challenges. If this is unreasonably difficult for you at the moment (for example if your recent work is under NDA, or if your current life situation makes it hard to spend the time) perhaps you can suggest an alternative way to show-case your way-of-working.\\n\\nTop reasons why you should join Hoxhunt\\n- Impact. Cybersecurity is a “hot” industry. You get to design a product that defends companies from cybercrime, help support the cyber-skills training for 500.000+ everyday professionals, and make the world more cyber-secure. \\n- Growth. Since 2016, the Hoxhunt family has grown from 4 founders to 90+ people\\n- Personal development. We value professional growth, peer-support, and learning and support this in various ways\\n- Culture. We have a strong company culture and care for our people. We promise you a fun but ambitious environment with lots of laughter.\\n- Benefits. We offer fair compensation and equity option packages. All of our employees have extensive health care. The office has plenty of opportunities to work out, go for a swim, eat a healthy (or not so healthy) snack.\\n- Flexibility. We have a cool office, but we also support remote working if you prefer (although we do think it’s important that you come to the office every now and then). Office hours are not set in stone. Getting the job done is what matters, not when or where it happens.\\n\xa0\\nOur Recruitment Process\\n1. Phone discussion with our Talent Acquisition team\\n2. Meeting with the Design Team lead and a Sr. Product Manager\\n3. Homework assignment related to your role. This should take about 2 hours, and it will be based on a purely fictional design challenge. Please let us know beforehand if you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process. \\n4. Team meeting and homework assignment review\u202f\\n5. Reference checks\\n\\nIf you are interested, please send us your details for example: LinkedIn / CV and portfolio.

We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers’ hands.\\n\\nWe’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.\\n\xa0\\nCommunications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.\\n\\n\\nWe’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications.\\n\xa0\\nAt Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns.
