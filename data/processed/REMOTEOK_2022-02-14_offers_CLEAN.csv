Headquartered in Sacramento, California, we have since grown out of our previous 3 offices and many of our close to 180 employees are spread all across the United States. Those 180 employees support close to 300,000 users across 5,000 offices nationwide and now in Canada as well. Included in that is 8 out of the 15 largest Real Estate Brokerages in the nation. But, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. All of the growth and success that has happened is a result of us obsessing over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. We know this only happens by hiring people who don’t just come up with out of the box ideas but hiring people who actually see those ideas through and bring them to life. As we’ve grown, we’ve been fortunate enough to hire plenty of people who possess that quality and realize it’s equally important to hire people who can pair that skill with empathy, collaboration, and a keen sense of urgency. If you’re looking to join a company where you can have real impact and surround yourself with an incredible team of people then look no further. xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 SKYSLOPE’S CORE VALUES These are the principles that helped us get to where we are and they are the principles that will guide us to where we want to go in the future.

Despite a lot of progress in developer tooling, most developers still roll their own authorization. At Oso, we ´re building the first batteries-included framework for authorization so developers don ´t have to roll it on their own anymore. We ´re building slick APIs so they can get started quickly, and a policy language under the hood so they can customize their system however they need. We started working with startups, and now companies like Intercom and Wayfair are migrating to Oso every week. What ´s unique about this opportunity is we are creating a market: while developers have been writing custom authorization code for decades, there has never been a standardized approach to this problem before. We ´ve proven out the market, but there is tons more work to do, and customers don ´t necessarily come right out with ´the answer ´ on what comes next. Like Michelangelo said about sculpting: Every block of stone has a statue inside it, and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it. Like a sculptor, as product leader you will work closely with our CTO, CEO and engineering team to discover and chart out our roadmap.

We started by demystifying complicated tax credits, saving over $100M – and countless hours of tax code research – for founders in nearly every industry. Then, we introduced MainStreet Procurement, simplifying expense management and contract negotiation for teams without the means to do it themselves. Since our sort-of viral beginnings in 2019, we’ve raised a $60M Series A (more on that later), launched two product lines (with more in the works), and grew from 3 employees to 160+. We owe our success to the strength of our team. Before joining MainStreet, we helped build companies like Intuit, PayPal, Google, Apple, Gusto, LinkedIn, Slack, and more. We’re 100% remote, spanning across X states and Canada. We’re fellow founders, engineers, accountants, designers, dog (and cat) lovers, adventurers, coders, and parents. We move fast. We think big. We don’t take ourselves too seriously. And we’d love for you to join us. The Opportunity: MainStreet is looking for multiple Security Engineers to help us protect our systems and customer data. You’ll have an opportunity to contribute to the architecture and security stance underlying the platform that powers MainStreet’s product suite. You’ll be responsible for designing and implementing secure cloud architecture, security policy, and secure business practices. About MainStreet MainStreet takes a holistic approach to small business management so you can grow smarter, not harder. We plug into your accounting and payroll systems to check for savings opportunities in unlikely places. From complex government tax credits to exclusive discounts on the tools you use every day, we save you thousands of dollars, hundreds of hours, and countless headaches. Throughout the year, you’ll track expenses and savings through your MainStreet dashboard and tag us in on big purchases and contract negotiations. Come tax season, we’ll do the paperwork and even let your CPA take all the credit. Consider us your silent partner-in-savings, your financial secret weapon, your smart (not a) bank – whatever you want to call us. We’ve got your back so you can get back to building your business. Our $60M Series A We’ve raised over $60M from an incredible community of partners, operators, and founders, including SignalFire (who led our Series A), Ryan Hoover (Product Hunt founder), Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Des Traynor (Intercom co-founder), Gradient Ventures (a Google Venture Fund), Ron Conway’s fund SV Angel, Shrug Capital, and Tusk Ventures. How we think about diversity We try to make sure the diversity of our customers is reflected in the team that serves them. Because when we include people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, ages, and identities — we end up building a better experience for everyone who uses MainStreet.

We’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands. Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that. We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications. At Telnyx, we´re looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You´re encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn´t precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns.

So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that. We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications. xa0 At Telnyx, we´re looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You´re encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn´t precisely match the job description.
