We’ve been experiencing tremendous growth as our team has grown from ~300 to 1000+ employees globally, and raised a $500M Series E funding in May 2021. As our growth accelerates further we are looking to hire 1,500 positions globally in the next xa0 3 years. We are looking for talented people like you to join us and help us continue to innovate and improve online experiences for all. We want the most ambitious, unique and enthusiastic people to join us and help us in this mission. Come join the #CSquad family! Our mission At Contentsquare, all employees share one goal: to help brands create exceptional online experiences with our industry-leading digital experience analytics platform. In the mobile data collection team, we are on a mission to build the industry leading digital experience analytics SDK. With a stellar growth, billions of users, a complex but rewarding business environment and the need for us to have a very high level of quality, performance and privacy, you’ll find an engaging and supportive work environment at Contentsquare. We are looking for developers who understand that development is a team effort, who are proud of a job well done and know how to implement simple and efficient solutions to solve challenging and unique problems. Our stack On the data collection side, our SDK works on native iOS applications (implemented in Swift) and native Android applications (SDK is in Java, Unit Tests and Sample App in Kotlin). We also support various multi-platform frameworks (React Native, Flutter, Capacitor/Ionic, Cordova) with specific bridges. Finally, the Web Team implements the Tag/SDK that collects data on websites (implemented in Typescript). Our APIs are mostly designed with our specific constraints in mind. For example, the most data intensive ones use Protocol Buffers. Our frontend is a micro-frontend SPA developed mainly in Angular/Vue.js and Node.js. Our backend uses a combination of technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Akka, ClickHouse and languages such as Scala, Golang, Python, C++. Our monitoring and deployment are handled through Kibana, Grafana, Terraform, Datadog and finally, everything is hosted on AWS and Azure. Our challenges Our first challenge is to navigate through uncharted territories, native APIs and poorly documented features to make sure we collect all the relevant data we need to compute our insights. In addition we obviously must ensure a very high level of performance (as well as the least impact on user experience), stability and be very mindful about data and CPU consumption. Our rapid growth requires a strong focus on software architecture, code sharing and automation to sustain our delivery capacity while increasing our teams´ size. Finally, we are not a tracking company, so collecting PII (Personal Identifiable Information) is an absolute no-go for us and we take it very seriously! Skills & Mindset If you have already worked on any kind of software SDK your experience will be of great interest to us. In the same way, if you have notable experience in high performance code, automated non-regression and performance testing, software bridges (between technologies, native and non-native), or if you enjoy testing new technologies or frameworks such as Flutter/Dart, Swift UI, Compose, React Native/Typescript, we would love to hear from you. As a team we are really involved in producing a high quality SDK.

However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details. One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our first product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible with minimal engineering overhead to both humans and machine-learning models in a scalable and privacy-preserving way. We xa0- are allergic to over-engineering. xa0- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo. xa0- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results. xa0 xa0- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it. xa0- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do). As an early member of our sales engineering team, you will help - scale and optimize our sales operations - shape our sales process, distribution strategy and culture. - experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives. - preparing and developing technical presentations to explain our company´s products and services to customers - collaborating with sales teams to understand customer requirements and provide sales support - setting and achieving sales goals and quotas The following are required: - experience with software engineering and REST APIs - at least 2 years of experience with the enterprise sales process FAQ What if I recommend someone who ends up getting hired? We will give you 10k USD for the referral. Where is Ntropy located? We are fully remote, with a virtual base in New York, US. What time-zones is this position for? Anywhere in the US. Preferably on the east coast. Do you consider part-time work? Not at the moment. Full-time roles only. How are you funded? We are backed by some of the top fintech investors in the world. Have raised single-digit millions of dollars so far. Can share more details over the call. Do you already have a product? Yes. We have been in production since 1st April 2021 and have been rapidly growing since. Do you plan to sell customer data? Ntropy is on a mission to enable products without data barriers. We will never sell customer data and will always put privacy and customer benefit ahead of any auxiliary financial gains. What is the interview process like? 1. Send us problems you have solved before and how. Please include as much detail as possible: code, algorithms, derivations, proofs, etc. We will then do a video call to kick things off and go through it (45 mins). 2. We will give you a take-home project in which you will use our API to build a simple personal finance app. Alternatively, if you have a relevant project that you worked on previously that demonstrates your skills as an engineer, you are welcome to use that instead. 3. We will then do a deep-dive through the project over a call and discuss the implementation, improvements and bottlenecks. Above all, we respect your time and commitment and will keep you up to speed on where we are at during the whole process. What are your hiring plans? We aim to be 22-25 people in the next 6 months. Mostly engineering roles. What is your current stack? back-end - Python + Rust (where performance matters) compute - AWS + Azure ML - PyTorch + ONNX infra - Redis (cache), RDS + S3 (storage), EKS + Lambda (auto-scaling), EC2 4xGPU nodes (training) Work / life balance?

FULL STACK ENGINEER,CATENDA,Worldwide,2022-02-18 14:56:28+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/106726-remote-full-stack-engineer-catenda,"Catenda catenda.no Apply now 3,440 views 131 applied (4%) Share this job: Get a rok.co short link Catenda is hiring a Remote Full Stack Engineer # Role The main responsibility for this position is to produce high quality code and shape together with the team the best practices vertically across the solution, including the frontend application, using React-Redux with TypeScript and the backend APIs. Also an important part of the job is to interact with our designer to create pixel perfect UIs according to design specs. In this role you will be working as part of a small and highly effective cross functional team, where most developers have a full stack understanding of the technical challenges. As a main developer in the team, you will be part of all major technical decisions, shaping the best practices and creating new features for our product Bimsync by deploying code to production regularly. # What we are looking for We are looking for a passionate Full Stack Engineer that wants to own and help shape our web application for the construction industry. You should have a good understanding of web and backend technologies and the different challenges of creating web applications backed by REST APIs that are cloud native, having previously developed applications in the public cloud (AWS preferably). We expect a strong intimacy with JavaScript, as our application runs mainly in React, Redux and Typescript, and Java, as most of our backend stack is written in this language. We also look for proficient knowledge of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, to tune and shape the best data structures for each particular use case. Another important point is having familiarity with REST APIs and a good understanding of backwards compatibility for public APIs. The list above is quite comprehensive and can be intimidating, but we don’t expect you to be familiar with our whole tech stack coming in. That said, you need to have a willingness to learn as you go, as we believe in a growing and learning mindset, where developers are ready to face new challenges, and learn new technologies when needed. Thus, having the right skills and a positive attitude to learning, is more important for us than the degree. A BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related subject is relevant, as we value an understanding of the fundamentals, but it’s not a prerequisite. We define ourselves as an agile company, so being open for feedback and adapting to change is core to being a good fit to our team. Our company´s working language is English, in which we expect all candidates to effectively communicate (written and spoken). This position is open for fully remote, but has a requirement of being located in the EU. # What we offer You will be part of an amazing journey to transform the construction industry with a bold and caring team. Along this path, we will challenge each other, have difficult open conversations, and develop as we learn. In addition to the above, we will also take care of you and provide you with the right challenges for growth. Some of our benefits: * Paid time off (25 vacation days per year) * Flexible working hours * Full remote possible * Share options program * Company gatherings twice a year (in person) # Catenda Catenda is a Norwegian scale-up company with a global ambition to make the construction industry data-driven, with less waste and greater transparency along the way. Our company values are two, easy to remember: xa0**Openness** xa0and xa0**Quality**. We believe in open standards for all our customer data to achieve interoperability between applications, from inception, through design and construction onto the maintenance of a building. Another core belief is that our customers should have full control over their data: all data that goes in, can also be exported out. We value quality of the code and the product by working as a tight and effective distributed development team, preferably asynchronously, often sharing screens to collaborate. Catenda has offices in Oslo and Bergen, composed by an international team of 10+ nationalities working remotely across the EU. Our solution, Bimsync, is a cloud-based collaboration platform, consisting of a web application, a mobile application and our APIs. Many companies across the world are using our products to build better airports, hospitals, stadiums, homes and roads. Our technology stack runs 100% on AWS, using the most appropriate technology for the problem at hand. As mentioned before, our backend is mostly in Java and frontend in Javascript, using React, Typescript and React Native for our mobile app (iOS and Android).
