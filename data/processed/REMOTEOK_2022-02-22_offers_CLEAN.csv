EF CAPITAL INVESTMENT ANALYST,EMPIRE FLIPPERS,Worldwide,2022-01-17 16:38:49+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/108275-remote-ef-capital-investment-analyst-empire-flippers,"´Empire Flippers Apply now 255 views 25 applied (10%) Empire Flippers is also hiring a: Finance Administrator Finance Administrator Customer Advisor Migration Advisor Content Specialist Empire Flippers is hiring a Remote EF Capital Investment Analyst We are looking to bring on another talented hire to join our EF Capital team starting March 28th, 2022. While the role will require you to put in some hours during US time zones, the role itself is location independent, allowing you to work and live anywhere in the world. Whether it ´s a beach in Bali, the side-streets of Tokyo, or a villa in Mexico -- the choice is yours. We ´re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters, excited about building a new division of an established, exciting internet company. You ´ll help build this new venture from the ground up, but with the guidance and expertise of a management team who ´s already done it successfully. You ´ll be plugging into a network of business professionals who invest, buy, and run successful, profitable internet companies. You ´ll be working with other driven professionals and mentored by a management team that truly wants to bring the best out in you. The industry is going through a period of explosive growth and our company is on the bleeding edge of investing in online businesses. This new asset class has been exploding in recent years and we need your help to scale. This is the position we wished we had when we were starting out! A remote position in a kick-ass remote company that works and plays hard. Ready to get started? If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position! **So What is an Investment Analyst?** An Investment Analyst works directly with operators on the EF Capital platform. You will be responsible for vetting the track record of successful online entrepreneurs who want to operate portfolios for EF Capital. This includes analyzing their current and past business performance to evaluate whether they are a good fit for our program. You will also be responsible for working with existing operators to help with due diligence on new business acquisitions and generate quarterly performance reports for investors. If you ´re selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it ´s a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Investment Analyst. **What ´s Our Story?** EF Capital is the latest division of Empire Flippers that enables investors to own fractional pieces of high-growth internet businesses. This is done by providing a marketplace to match up passive investors and experienced online business operators to purchase and run profitable online businesses. Empire Flippers was started back in 2011 as a place to buy small advertising sites. The company was started by two founders working from home and now has more than 85 people working all around the world, successfully selling more than $360,000,000 in online businesses. The goal remains simple -- connect the sellers of high quality businesses with entrepreneurial buyers. The problem EF Capital solves is that buying an online business requires a particular skill-set -- one that many investors, high net-worth individuals, and investment funds just don ´t have. This skill-set issue is a limiting factor that, once solved, could open the floodgates in taking this asset class mainstream. Empire Flippers has already established incredible market demand. The company has more than $5.5 billion in verified liquidity from potential investors with more being added every month. EF Capital is in a unique position to pair investable capital with our established network of accomplished and experienced entrepreneurs and portfolio managers. In our first year we successfully completed 2 Rounds of EFC funding $13M+. Our Round 1 operators are growing their businesses and our Round 2 operators are in the process of deploying capital. We ´re now ready to expand the program so that we can start operating at even greater scale. That ´s where you come in! **What ´s the Opportunity?** Becoming an Investment Analyst will put you in a critical role at EF Capital. You ´ll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment. The work will be challenging and you may find yourself wearing several different hats along the way. While we have the support and backing of a larger established company and brand, it ´s not wrong to say this will compare closely to a rapidly growing startup in the financial services sector. You won ´t be another cog in the wheel of some larger corporation. You won ´t be employee #30492 looking to skate by and hope that your peers or supervisor can cover for you. You ´ll be an absolutely critical player in a company with big expectations and opportunity. Your work ethic and skill-set will have a direct impact on our growth. You ´ll gain access to our Rolodex, receive direct training, mentorship and support, and gain valuable insights into the online business space that no course could ever teach you. You ´ll be working right away with savvy investors, successful entrepreneurs running dozens or hundreds of sites, and portfolio owners and management teams running global product brands. Do you want a seat at the table? A real shot to be a leader and have a voice in a fast-growing industry? If we ´re a good fit for each other, that ´s exactly what you ´ll get with this position. **What ´s This Investment Analyst Position Like?** While you can expect to work hard and wear many different hats, we ´re not terribly corporate. Empire Flippers has been an INC 5000 company for a number of years, but we ´re completely bootstrapped, have no board to answer to, and are focused on results, not politics. You ´ll find much of the same at EF Capital. When you first come on board as an Investment Advisor, you will start learning more about our industry before jumping into the job. First you will learn about the different types of online businesses available for sale on Empire Flippers. Then you will learn about EF Capital. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how investments are structured down to intricacies of business acquisitions. Once you have the basics down, we will train you how to value online businesses and evaluate past performance. You will spend a lot of time working with numbers in Google Sheets. This is not a sales role but you must be very comfortable on the phone and willing to reach out to clients when needed. You might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you ´re up and going? Here is a list of daily tasks we ´ll expect from you (not exhaustive and subject to change): - Building a P&L on a potential operator ´s previous business to help us decide whether to accept them for EF Capital - Hosting calls with potential operators to discuss their previous or current portfolio performance to understand the risks of their strategy xa0 - Evaluating an existing operator ´s acquisition target and helping the operator project returns to investors based on different variables such as growth and purchase multiple - Working with third party accounting firms and existing operators to put together financial statements and quarterly update reports for investors - Figuring out ways to improve our existing process to maximize investor returns and create a better experience for operators **What Skills Are Needed?** We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with. However, that doesn ´t mean we aren ´t looking for a certain kind of skill-set. While no previous work experience is needed, experience in an analytical role is a big plus. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don ´t have that experience, don ´t let it stop you from applying. You must be comfortable talking and with people. You need to be able to pick up the phone and call someone to work through complex issues. You need to be detail-oriented. Being an analyst is a meticulous job. You will be pouring through spreadsheets, traffic analytics, and revenue data, day in and day out. It is up to you to spot errors, inconsistencies, or when something just doesn ´t feel right. Every day, you will speak with entrepreneurs about scaling businesses, liabilities, and how good certain assets are as an investment. Over time, you will need to be able to spot genuine risks and opportunities with online businesses. You will need to be able to confidently analyze each potential opportunity and make a recommendation. While investing in online businesses can bring great returns, it can also be a volatile space to play in. We take a consultative approach with customers. We ´re not trying to fit square pegs into round holes. We truly believe that the best experience includes transparency -- which sometimes means letting the other person know why they shouldn ´t do the deal. You ´re a problem solver. Investing in these businesses can be a very important decision and a very intimate experience for entrepreneurs. That means you will face obstacles and challenges. It will be up to you to make sure those challenges are met head-on and solved for all parties in the deal. You ´re excited about expanding the EF Capital brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us. **What ´s the Lifestyle Like?** Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! We aren ´t going to chain you to a cubicle. You ´ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves you best. The choice is yours. You won ´t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our investors and operators. We typically require all new hires to work in-person with their manager for the first 3-6 months to get up to speed quickly and create a close knit group. After that, employees are free to live anywhere in the world. Due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, xa0**we are not making this a requirement**. We will offer an optional 2-month in-person training in either Medellin, Colombia or Phuket, Thailand with the EF Capital Team. Again, attending this in-person training is optional and won ´t be a hiring requirement. Our company holds biannual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. Our meetups were on hold for 2020, but in 2021 we were able to gather together again as a team for a fun filled week in Las Vegas! For the first 6 months, you will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. After 6 months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan and will have paid, international healthcare coverage. Within 12 months, you can expect to be earning $60,000 -- $80,000 USD per year depending on performance. With this being a new venture, there is a lot of opportunity to move into management roles with significantly higher pay. **Love It. What ´s the Catch?** We love our team and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table. We love to play and travel. A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work awfully hard. Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you ´re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the world. Sometimes we really do work next to the beach. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil with a 12-hour work day through the night. That isn ´t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a client ´s series of questions, so you ´ll need to be prepared for that. A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job. We want you to become a long-term employee with us. Ultimately, we want this position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company. Also we ´re looking for people who can step into management roles as the company grows. **The Details to Keep in Mind** Remember, we ´re not going to throw you into the fire right away. As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later working more independently. Our team will review every application that comes our way. If you ´re a good fit, we will schedule an interview. Typically, we do two rounds of interviews before we decide. The cut-off date for applying is January 28th. xa0 Applications will be reviewed as they come in so apply early. Expected start date is March 28th. If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role.

This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth---and there is no sign of it slowing down. Becoming a Marketing Analytics Specialist makes you a critical part of Empire Flippers. You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. With a multi-channel marketing funnel and lengthy sales cycle, tracking and attribution has been an absolute necessity at Empire Flippers. As we continue to see rapid growth, we are seeking someone to help us improve and build upon our existing systems. The Marketing Analytics Specialist is a full-time position for an individual with experience using multiple analytical tools/software and a forward-thinking mentality. Our company is growing at a fast rate, which means excellent opportunities for personal and career growth. **What ´s the Position Like?** As the Marketing Analytics Specialist at Empire Flippers, you ´ll be doing more than monitoring and reporting. You ´ll also plan and help implement strategies to optimize conversions, increase ROI, and reach new customers. Here ´s a quick look at some of your responsibilities: - Produce dashboards and regular, cross-channel performance reports with actionable insights for our teams to improve upon - Identify conversion rate optimization opportunities to test across our digital platforms - Implement tracking for new campaigns and optimize existing tracking methods - Analyze user behavior, conversion data, customer journeys, funnels, and multi-channel attribution for opportunities to improve - Monitor and forecast marketplace trends to provide metrics and insights to our content team for timely blog posts, case studies, and reports - Work daily with software including but not limited to Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and HubSpot - Convert data into easy-to-understand visualizations such as infographics, Google Data Studio reports, charts, graphs, etc. **What Skills Do I Need?** **You need to have immaculate attention to detail.** xa0As you already know, one tiny mistake can drastically change the data. We are looking for someone detail-oriented that quickly recognizes the signs something isn ´t right or team members are misinterpreting data. **A can-do attitude.** xa0You understand resilience and being able to power through obstacles that come your way. You ´re open to collaboration to get things done and you try to bring your best to everything you do. **Be a good communicator.** xa0Not everyone will be able to wrap their heads around the data as quickly as you. Good communication will be an essential part of this role as you ´ll be presenting findings to other team members and departments. **A self-starter.** xa0We need to see some evidence that you ´re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you ´ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won ´t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day-to-day basis, so you ´ll be working in almost full autonomy. We ´ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. In a nutshell: you must be highly motivated, goal-driven, and coachable. **Required Skills** We are seeking someone with advanced knowledge of the following: - HubSpot Marketing Hub with focus on the analytics tools, reports, attribution, and dashboards - Universal Google Analytics with custom event and dimension experience xa0 - Google Analytics 4 (GA4) - Google Tag Manager - Google Data Studio - Spreadsheets with focus on pivot tables, QUERY, VLOOKUP, simulations, and INDEX MATCH **Preferred Skills** Other software knowledge that isn ´t required, but we find valuable: - Monday.com productivity tool - HubSpot Sales Hub - Ahrefs xa0 - Wicked Reports - BigQuery - Tableau - Illustrator/Photoshop - Google Search Console - Zapier xa0 - Familiarity with how API integrations work - Youtube analytics **What ´s the Lifestyle Like?** Our company culture is built on the idea of travel, remote work, and living life on your terms.

Apart from meeting us in person every now and then, you ´re free to work and live anywhere you ´d like and join the new class of digital nomads -- we ´re homeless but have a passport, credit card, and a laptop. You ´ll become friends with people who will be able to give you massive insights into how digital businesses work, how they scale, and, of course, how to invest in them or sell them. **Love It. What ´s the Catch?** This isn ´t a gap year experience. This is not a temporary contract. If you ´re applying just because you want something to fund your travels before you start seeking out a serious job, then you probably shouldn ´t apply. We ´re looking for career-minded people who share our vision and see where we ´re going. We want you to be part of that vision and help us get there over the long haul. And while we play hard and sometimes really do work next to the pool all day, we work even harder. Sometimes you will be putting in a 10-12 hour day as business demands arise. You ´ll be working weird hours to match other team members time zones, and you ´ll sometimes have to face some critical feedback. You will be expected to perform to our expectations and really help us grow our business to the next level. We ´re counting on you. If you can see yourself growing into a profitable and meaningful career with us and love what we do, we want you to be part of our team. **Details to Keep in Mind** While the Marketing Analytics Specialist role will in large part be built from scratch, this position itself is not an entry level role. You will earn $2,000/month base rate plus immediately join our lucrative bonus sharing plan. Should company performance hit 100% of on-target earnings, this role has a very good opportunity to earn $65,000 in the first year. We ´re going to start you off slow. You ´ll first learn about our company and what each department does; then you will be given some low-level tasks to ease you into the position. Over time, your skills will grow and you ´ll be making a lot of decisions on your own. However, you will always have our support and knowledge to lean on. We aren ´t going to throw you to the wolves --- you ´ll be part of a high-functioning team that is here to help wherever we can. Our Director of Marketing and Marketing Ops Supervisor will be reviewing every application. If we think you ´re a good fit, we will reach out to you to do a video call interview. After the first interviews are done, our final candidates will be brought back for a final second interview before we make our decision. ***US resident requirements: If you are in the US, we will accept candidates residing in Texas, Florida, or Colorado, as we are registered for payroll in these states. Otherwise, US candidates should plan to live abroad or have plans to relocate to Texas, Florida, or Colorado.** **We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites.

We ´re not looking to put you in a cubicle and waste your time in traffic. You ´ll be working hard, playing hard, and learning all about our company and what we stand for during this time. Apart from meeting us in person every now and then, you ´re free to work and live anywhere you ´d like and join the new class of digital nomads -- we ´re homeless but have a passport, credit card, and a laptop. You ´ll become friends with people who will be able to give you massive insights into how digital businesses work, how they scale, and, of course, how to invest in them or sell them. **Love It. What ´s the Catch?** This isn ´t a gap year experience. This is not a temporary contract. If you ´re applying just because you want something to fund your travels before you start seeking out a serious job, then you probably shouldn ´t apply. We ´re looking for career-minded people who share our vision and see where we ´re going. We want you to be part of that vision and help us get there over the long haul. And while we play hard and sometimes really do work next to the pool all day, we work even harder. Sometimes you will be putting in a 10-12 hour day as business demands arise. You ´ll be working weird hours to match other team members time zones, and you ´ll sometimes have to face some critical feedback. You will be expected to perform to our expectations and really help us grow our business to the next level. We ´re counting on you. If you can see yourself growing into a profitable and meaningful career with us and love what we do, we want you to be part of our team. **Details to Keep in Mind** While the xa0 Demand Generation Specialist role will in large part be built from scratch, this position itself is not an entry level role. You will earn $2,000/month base rate plus immediately join our lucrative bonus sharing plan. Should company performance hit 100% of on-target earnings, this role has a very good opportunity to earn $65,000 in the first year. We ´re going to start you off slow. You ´ll first learn about our company and what each department does; then you will be given some low-level tasks to ease you into the position. Over time, your skills will grow and you ´ll be making a lot of decisions on your own. However, you will always have our support and knowledge to lean on. We aren ´t going to throw you to the wolves --- you ´ll be part of a high-functioning team that is here to help wherever we can. Our Director of Marketing and Marketing Ops Supervisor will be reviewing every application. If we think you ´re a good fit, we will reach out to you to do a video call interview. After the first interviews are done, our final candidates will be brought back for a final second interview before we make our decision. ***US resident requirements: If you are in the US, we will accept candidates residing in Texas, Florida, or Colorado, as we are registered for payroll in these states. Otherwise, US candidates should plan to live abroad or have plans to relocate to Texas, Florida, or Colorado.** **We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not apply.** **A background check is required. xa0** Be sure to mention the word **OPENNESS** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

EF CAPITAL CONTENT MARKETING SPECIALIST,EMPIRE FLIPPERS,Worldwide,2022-01-17 10:15:35+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/108267-remote-ef-capital-content-marketing-specialist-empire-flippers,"Empire Flippers Apply now 269 views 22 applied (8%) Empire Flippers is also hiring a: Finance Administrator Finance Administrator Customer Advisor Migration Advisor Content Specialist Empire Flippers is hiring a Remote EF Capital Content Marketing Specialist We are looking to bring on another talented hire to join our EF Capital team starting March 28th, xa0 2022. While the role will require you to put in some hours during US time zones, the role itself is location independent, allowing you to work and live anywhere in the world. Whether it´s a beach in Bali, the side-streets of Tokyo, or a villa in Mexico -- the choice is yours. We´re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters, excited about building a new division of an established, exciting internet company. You´ll help build this new venture from the ground up, but with the guidance and expertise of a management team who´s already done it successfully. You´ll be plugging into a network of business professionals who invest, buy, and run successful, profitable internet companies. You´ll be working with other driven professionals and mentored by a management team that truly wants to bring the best out in you. The industry is going through a period of explosive growth and our company is on the bleeding edge of investing in online businesses. This new asset class has been exploding in recent years and we need your help to scale. This is the position we wished we had when we were starting out! A remote position in a kick-ass remote company that works and plays hard. Ready to get started? If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position! **So What is a Content Marketing Specialist?** A Content Specialist is a marketing professional who works on many different marketing channels for EF Capital. The high level responsibilities are to spread the word about this exciting new investment platform, maintain an online presence in relevant communities, and support the team by increasing conversions. You will be responsible for writing content in the form of blog posts, email blasts to investors and operators, developing sales marketing collateral for our webpage, and reviewing other online investment platforms to ensure we are staying competitive. You will also be responsible for writing and publishing our quarterly investment reports as well as acquisition updates for our investors. This includes explaining EF Capital terms, processes, and the benefits of working with us. The person in this role must love the challenge of writing across many different mediums. If you´re selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it´s a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Content Marketing Specialist. **What´s Our Story?** EF Capital is the latest division of Empire Flippers that enables investors to own fractional pieces of high-growth internet businesses. This is done by providing a marketplace to match up passive investors and experienced online business operators to purchase and run profitable online businesses. Empire Flippers was started back in 2011 as a place to buy small advertising sites. The company was started by two founders working from home and now has more than 85 people working all around the world, successfully selling more than $360,000,000 in online businesses. The goal remains simple -- connect the sellers of high quality businesses with entrepreneurial buyers. The problem EF Capital solves is that buying an online business requires a particular skill-set -- one that many investors, high net-worth individuals, and investment funds just don´t have. This skill-set issue is a limiting factor that, once solved, could open the floodgates in taking this asset class mainstream. Empire Flippers has already established incredible market demand. The company has more than $5.5 billion in verified liquidity from potential investors with more being added every month. EF Capital is in a unique position to pair investable capital with our established network of accomplished and experienced entrepreneurs and portfolio managers. In our first year we successfully completed 2 Rounds of EFC funding $13M+. Our Round 1 operators are growing their businesses and our Round 2 operators are in the process of deploying capital. We´re now ready to expand the program so that we can start operating at even greater scale. That´s where you come in! **What´s the Opportunity?** Becoming a Content Specialist will put you in a critical role at EF Capital. You´ll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment. The work will be challenging and you may find yourself wearing several different hats along the way. While we have the support and backing of a larger established company and brand, it´s not wrong to say this will compare closely to a rapidly growing startup in the financial services sector. You won´t be another cog in the wheel of some larger corporation. You won´t be employee #30492 looking to skate by and hope that your peers or supervisor can cover for you. You´ll be an absolutely critical player in a company with big expectations and opportunity. Your work ethic and skill-set will have a direct impact on our growth. You´ll gain access to our Rolodex, receive direct training, mentorship and support, and gain valuable insights into the online business space that no course could ever teach you. You´ll be working right away with savvy investors, successful entrepreneurs running dozens or hundreds of sites, and portfolio owners and management teams running global product brands. Do you want a seat at the table? A real shot to be a leader and have a voice in a fast-growing industry? If we´re a good fit for each other, that´s exactly what you´ll get with this position. **What´s This Content Specialist Position Like?** While you can expect to work hard and wear many different hats, we´re not terribly corporate. Empire Flippers has been an INC 5000 company for a number of years, but we´re completely bootstrapped, have no board to answer to, and are focused on results, not politics. You´ll find much of the same at EF Capital. When you first come on board as a Content Marketing Specialist, you will start learning more about our industry before jumping into the job. First you will learn about the different types of online businesses available for sale on Empire Flippers. Then you will learn about EF Capital. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how investments are structured down to the intricacies of business acquisitions. You will learn about what each department in the company does and who to work with to accomplish your projects. Once you have the basics down, you will start working with our team, contractors, and customers directly. This is not a sales role but you will spend a significant amount of time collaborating with others and must be very comfortable jumping on calls and collaborating with other team members when needed. You will wear many different hats and will need to prioritize projects based on urgency and importance. You might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you´re up and going? While you will work on many different things and each day could look different to the next, here is an example of potential tasks: - Writing sales and marketing collateral for our website (landing page, FAQ, and investment deal pages) - Developing email blasts that drive traffic to our sales team xa0 - Being an active poster in various investing and online business communities - Writing blog posts with content that captures the tone of our mission and brings new investors into the fold - Providing quarterly updates on each investment deal to investors throughout the life of each investment - Figuring out ways to improve our existing process to make it a better experience for both investors and operators **What Skills Are Needed?** We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with. However, that doesn´t mean we aren´t looking for a certain kind of skill-set. You must have an affinity for writing. You either have a portfolio of published work or are actively learning about how to be a better writer. Maybe you´re passionate about writing and creating content and you naturally gravitate towards anything related to that sphere. You´ll be writing a lot in this role so being able to show an interest and foundation in writing is essential. Experience writing in the finance and investment space is a big plus. You need to be able to create content that will resonate with investors. Having the ability to understand complex financial concepts and write about them clearly and succinctly is essential for this role. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don´t have that experience, don´t let it stop you from applying. You need to be a team player. You´ll be working closely with multiple teams and contractors. You need to be good at communicating your thoughts and getting buy-in from colleagues. Having a deadline focus and being able to knock down barriers to getting stuff done is essential to thriving on our team. You´re excited about expanding the EF Capital brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us. **What´s the Lifestyle Like?** Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! We aren´t going to chain you to a cubicle. You´ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves you best. The choice is yours. You won´t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our investors and operators. We typically require all new hires to work in-person with their manager for the first 3-6 months to get up to speed quickly and create a close knit group. After that, employees are free to live anywhere in the world. Due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, xa0**we are not making this a requirement**. We will offer an optional 2-month in-person training in either Medellin, Colombia or Phuket, Thailand with the EF Capital Team. Again, attending this in-person training is optional and won´t be a hiring requirement. Our company holds biannual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. Our meetups were on hold for 2020, but in 2021 we were able to gather together again as a team for a fun filled week in Las Vegas! For the first 6 months, you will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. After 6 months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan and will have paid, international healthcare coverage. Within 12 months, you can expect to be earning $60,000 -- $80,000 USD per year depending on performance and experience. With this being a new venture, there is a lot of opportunity to move into management roles with significantly higher pay. **Love It. What´s the Catch?** We love our team and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table. We love to play and travel. A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work awfully hard. Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you´re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the world. Sometimes we really do work next to the beach. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil with a 12-hour work day through the night. That isn´t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a client´s series of questions, so you´ll need to be prepared for that. A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job. We want you to become a long-term employee with us. Ultimately, we want this position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company. Also we´re looking for people who can step into management roles as the company grows. **The Details to Keep in Mind** Remember, we´re not going to throw you into the fire right away. As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later working more independently. Our team will review every application that comes our way. If you´re a good fit, we will schedule an interview. Typically, we do two rounds of interviews before we decide. The cut-off date for applying is January 28th. xa0 Applications will be reviewed as they come in so apply early. Expected start date is March 28th. If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role. Be sure to mention the word **INTRICATE** when applying to show you read the job post completely. This is a beta feature to avoid spam applicants. Companies can search these words to find applicants that read this and see they´re human. #Salary and compensation $40,000 — $80,000/year #Location Worldwide See more jobs at Empire Flippers","['marketing', 'content', 'non tech']",https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK,40000,80000,60000.0,3,Year,4,,full-time,True,True,True,conversational,1

You might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you ´re up and going? Here is a list of daily tasks we ´ll expect from you (not exhaustive and subject to change): - Take calls with potential operators and answering their questions on how we structure investment deals and how they can participate - Call potential investors who have expressed interest in investing and guiding them to the next step in our sales funnel - Return emails to potential operators or investors who are looking at using our platform, but still have questions about our process - Work closely with our team to improve marketing based on your conversations with investors and operators xa0 - Figure out ways to improve our existing process to make it a better experience for both investors and operators **What Skills Are Needed?** We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally.

You need to be able to pick up the phone and call someone who doesn ´t know you and see how they are doing. This isn ´t cold-calling, everyone you call will have expressed some interest in working with EF Capital and have given out their phone number, so they will be familiar with the company. It is your task to make sure they understand our processes and see why we are someone they want to work with. You can spot risks and opportunities. Every day, you will speak with investors and entrepreneurs about scaling businesses, liabilities, and how good certain assets are as an investment. Over time, you will need to be able to spot genuine risks and opportunities with online businesses. You will need to be able to confidently tell the entire story behind each potential investment opportunity. While investing in online businesses can bring great returns, it can also be a volatile space to play in. We take a consultative approach with customers. We ´re not trying to fit square pegs into round holes. We truly believe that the best sales experience includes transparency -- which sometimes means letting the customer know why they shouldn ´t do the deal. Having that confidence will allow you to be that much more effective and persuasive when the right customer is looking at the right deal. Along those lines, we respect our audience ´s intelligence by telling them about both the risks and rewards. You ´re a problem solver. Investing in these businesses can be a very important decision and a very intimate experience for entrepreneurs and operators on the other side of the deal. That means you will face obstacles and challenges. It will be up to you to make sure those challenges are met head-on and solved for all parties in the deal.

This is a full-time position and great for those who are curious and love to expand their knowledge. The online business industry is vast. You ´ll cover everything from eCommerce, SaaS, private equity, affiliate marketing, SEO, to entrepreneurship, just to name a few. In this role, you ´ll become a powerhouse creator who can deliver content on just about every topic in online business. **What ´s the Position Like?** The Content Specialist position is vital to the success of our company. To excel in this role you should be a strong communicator, writer, and storyteller. You have a sense of what is most compelling to an audience and understand what they might need to hear/read to walk away feeling like they got value from a piece of content. You should be able to deliver on the voice and quality standards of Empire Flippers content alone and in collaboration with our marketing team. Speaking of collaboration -- you should feel excited about really nesting into our marketing team. We work closely together to meet our quarterly and yearly goals and you ´ll regularly meet with the team to make sure you ´re on track. But outside of a few regular meetings, for the most part, you ´re independent and working on your own time to craft great content. The ability to be self-sufficient and thrive in an independent environment will be important. Here ´s a look at some of the tasks and processes you ´ll be responsible for: **Routine Job Duties** - Writing listing descriptions for new businesses going live on our marketplace - Outreach to off-site publications and websites with a goal of creating 1 in-depth industry-related blog post per month. - Optimize content with best SEO industry practices. - Publishing story and data-driven blog content twice a month. - Monitor mentions and backlinks across the web for potential content opportunities. - Manage and improve the ongoing editorial calendar. - Interviewing sellers for the RMRB podcast **Big projects content specialists could collaborate on:** - Content repurposing - Creating graphics for content - Data-driven content - Customized email marketing campaigns - Collaboration on large marketing campaigns i.e Season of the Seller - Launching new podcasts and YouTube shows **What Skills Do I Need?** We train you for every facet of the job and believe cultural fit is most important when we are hiring. So you ´ll learn everything on the job but you should come to the table with these qualities and skills. **Affinity for writing**. You either have a portfolio of published work or are actively learning about how to be a better writer. Maybe you ´re passionate about writing and creating content and you naturally gravitate towards anything related to that sphere. You ´ll be writing a lot in this role so being able to show an interest or foundation in writing will be helpful. **A can-do attitude**. You understand resilience and being able to power through obstacles that come your way. You ´re open to collaboration to get things done and you try to bring your best to everything you do. Be a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you ´ll be brainstorming with team members in other departments, developing and collaborating on overall content strategy for both short-term and long-term goals, and creating new content ideas. **A self-starter**. We need to see some evidence that you ´re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you ´ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won ´t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day-to-day basis, you ´ll be working in almost full autonomy, we ´ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. In a nutshell: you must be highly motivated, goal-driven, and coachable. **You need to have immaculate attention to detail**. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if a word or grammatical structure doesn ´t quite look or feel right, as you ´ll be creating two pieces of in-depth written content per month to be published on the blog. Writing, editing, and proofreading are a large part of this role for all content being produced. **Preferred Skills** - A deep understanding of crafting written, story-driven content marketing pieces - Strong emphasis on editing skills across various writing styles to ensure overall brand messaging remains top of mind - Basic to intermediate social media knowledge - Basic to intermediate SEO knowledge - Basic to intermediate email marketing automation knowledge - Basic to intermediate graphic design skills - Podcast and video production knowledge - Journalism background - Especially in Amazon FBA, DTC e-commerce or SaaS related **What ´s the Lifestyle Like?** (https://empireflippers.com/) **Empire Flippers**(https://empireflippers.com/) has grown tremendously in the past few years and we are now a team of 80 people dispersed across the entire globe. Our company culture is built on the idea of travel, remote work, and living life on your terms. We ´re not looking to put you in a cubicle and waste your time in traffic. You ´ll be working hard, playing hard, and learning all about our company and what we stand for during this time. Apart from meeting us in person every now and then, you ´re free to work and live anywhere you ´d like and join the new class of digital nomads -- we ´re homeless but have a passport, credit card, and a laptop. The marketing team is where you ´ll call home. We are a close-knit team of eight currently and are expanding to a team of 10-14 very soon. Currently, we ´re located in Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea, The Philippines, United Kingdom, Croatia, and Mexico. Though that location often changes, thanks to all that remote work freedom. We work hard together, support each other, and have a good sense of humor. We want to see each other win because we know that creates a winning scenario for our customers and Empire Flippers as a whole. Our new hires will be an important part of our team and will be working closely with the entirety of our marketing team and will regularly connect with Empire Flippers ´ other departments. **Love It. What ´s the Catch?** This isn ´t a gap year experience. This is not a temporary contract. If you ´re applying just because you want something to fund your travels before you start seeking out a serious job, then you probably shouldn ´t apply. We ´re looking for career-minded people who share our vision and see where we ´re going. We want you to be part of that vision and help us get there over the long haul. And while we play hard and sometimes really do work next to the pool all day, we work even harder. Sometimes you will be putting in a 10-12 hour day as business demands arise. You ´ll be working weird hours to match other team members time zones, and you ´ll sometimes have to face some critical feedback. You will be expected to perform to our expectations and really help us grow our business to the next level. We ´re counting on you. If you can see yourself growing into a profitable and meaningful career with us and love what we do, we want you to be part of our team. **Details to Keep in Mind** This position is a fully remote role. During the first six month period, your role will be probationary and your training and performance will be evaluated. You can expect to be earning $2,000/month base rate. Following probation, you will join our lucrative bonus sharing plan. Should company performance hit 100% of on target earnings, this role has a very good opportunity to earn between $50,000-$60,000 annually. We also offer international healthcare coverage that you will receive once you ´re out of the probationary period. We offer a stellar unlimited PTO (paid time off) xa0 policy as well. We ´re going to start you off slow. You ´ll first learn about our company and what each department does; then you will be given some low-level tasks to ease you into the position. Over time, your skills will grow and you ´ll be making a lot of decisions on your own. However, you will always have our support and knowledge to lean on. We aren ´t going to throw you to the wolves --- you ´ll be part of a high-functioning team that is here to help wherever we can. ***US resident requirements: If you ´re in the US, we will accept candidates residing in Texas, Florida, or Colorado, as we are registered for payroll in these states. Otherwise, US candidates should plan to live abroad or have plans to relocate to Texas, Florida, or Colorado.** **We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not apply.** **A background check is required. xa0** Here is the sequence of events we use when hiring our Content Specialist: - You record a YouTube video* explaining who you are and why you ´re a good fit for the position. - The deadline is February 11, 2022. - We review submissions and schedule interviews in mid February. - The chosen candidate will begin March 16, 2022. ***YouTube Video Requirements:** We will only accept submissions that include a YouTube URL. Please leave the video unlisted in preferences and share the link with us. The quality of the video doesn ´t matter, and there are no bonus points for editing. We just want (up to) three minutes of you explaining (based on your previous experience) why this position is an excellent fit for you and us.

But obesity treatment is radically changing due to a new wave of medication options which are 2-3x more effective than previous options. In addition, only 10% of those using weight management services are men: all programs market to women, not tackling the stigma men feel around this. Fella ´s founders are Luke(https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-harries) & Richie(https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-cartwright). We studied together at Cambridge University. - Luke xa0studied pre-med and developed a patented AI approach to detecting cancer xa0at a YC bio company, before moving to Microsoft Research. He also has a masters in Computer Science. - Richie was a data scientist, building and selling an AI company working with the UK government.

FULL STACK ENGINEER,SONA,Worldwide,2022-01-11 16:32:41+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/108140-remote-full-stack-engineer-sona,"Sona getsona.com Apply now 1,683 views 140 applied (8%) Sona is hiring a Remote Full Stack Engineer 80% of the global workforce is deskless, yet just 1% of all enterprise software funding is dedicated to serving these 2.7 billion people. At Sona, our mission is to put cutting edge technology in the hands of every deskless employee to empower them to do their best work. We’re a rapidly growing, VC-backed B2B SaaS startup founded in the summer of 2021. We are fully remote, with overlapping ‘office hours’ during the mornings (GMT). We are strong believers in giving everyone the autonomy to do their best work, when and how they prefer. That means you’ll have a lot of flexibility and control over how to shape your job and work life, while getting all the support you need to succeed. We take our health and mental health seriously, believing that we can only perform to our best when we are healthy and happy. That’s why we work 4.5 day weeks, with a flexible half day that you can use as you choose. You can learn more about the team and what it’s like working at Sona here(https://www.notion.so/getsona/Working-at-Sona-4e3c00206c414d8c9eb9b7a617cdc6d7) ### About the role We fundamentally believe that the best products are built when small, cross functional, autonomous teams are empowered to solve business problems as they see fit. You’ll be joining a pod which owns a particular area of the product and movement between product areas is encouraged and easy. Engineers are heavily involved throughout the product development process, inputting into the why and what as well as the how. *Our stack has two main components:* * A backend with a GraphQL API (for communicating with the Native App) and a web frontend built using Elixir and Phoenix Live View (the PETAL stack) * A native mobile application built in React Native + Typescript We think in terms of “T Shaped” developers. This means that while all of us have some ability across the “full stack”, most of us have one side of the stack (e.g. Elixir or React Native) we’re stronger on and spend the bulk of our time on. We’re passionate advocates of the Live View approach for building web applications and believe that it’s one of the biggest step changes in productivity and developer experience since Ruby on Rails. Likewise we strongly believe in the benefits of the common, typesafe Android and iOS codebase that React Native combined with Typescript and GraphQL gives us. Typically when somebody starts working with us, they have strong experience with one side of the stack and then learn the other part on the job. ### How We Work Our engineering principles(https://www.notion.so/getsona/Engineering-Team-Principles-b83ffe9620a645e5920529ad79928c66)give a flavour of how we like to work. We’re a fully remote team spread across 4 countries (and growing). We have a company stand up most mornings at 10:00 UK time. We aim to have fully paid for company meetups roughly once per quarter. Everything starts with talking to customers. We like everyone in the company to regularly join either sales calls with new prospects or catch ups with existing customers We’re a small company with a strong preference for lightweight, asynchronous processes. Within product we work in sprints with periodic retrospectives. ### Interview Process Our hiring process follows this pattern: * Initial phone screen (30 minutes) focused primarily on approach to work, career goals and your questions about Sona * Technical Interview (1-2 hours) take us through a piece of code you´re proud of and talk about how it´s architected, what worked well and what you´d do differently if you wrote it again. If you don´t have a suitable piece of code, we´re also happy to pay you for half a days work to do a take home task. But we understand that everyone´s busy so we´d much rather use some code you´ve already got where possible! * Founder Interview (1 hour), focused on why you’re interested in Sona and your questions about the vision ### Requirements We love engineers who have a non nonsense approach to “getting it shipped”, who when given the choice between “complicated and shiny” vs “get something simple in front of a user” will always choose the latter. Everybody’s different, but a lot of the following probably applies to you: * You have extensive professional experience in either React Native or Elixir * If your experience is in React Native you’re happy to talk about Typescript, the role of generics and when they should be used, how hooks changed how we build React Native apps and when one should consider writing custom hooks. You’d be equally happy explaining promises and how they interact with async / await. * If your experience is in Elixir you’re passionate about LiveView and are comfortable talking about it’s advantages and challenges * You have a strong preference towards taking ownership, making sure you’re clear on what you’re doing and why and then communicating progress over awaiting instruction * You’re in a country which is GMT +/- 3 and fluent communicating both verbally and in writing in English ### Benefits * Competitive salary * 4.5 day standard working week * 37 days annual leave (25 days standard plus 12 flexible ‘bank holiday’ days) * Share options * Fully remote and flexible working * Co-working space stipend * Free mental health support (On-demand online therapy & coaching) * Quarterly all expenses paid team retreats * The latest Macbook and equipment for your home office * Professional development budget * Unlimited free books Be sure to mention the word **AWE** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Thus we still run a moderate cloud stack on the Google Cloud Platform. As you can see in the description of our stack, we use Hashicorp ´s tools for deployment. That means a Consul + Vault cluster, and Nomad to schedule (container) jobs. That actually runs stable without too much maintenance. Most of the work is in improving the experience of other developers, and making it easier for them to do the things they need to do on the operations side. For example, we use Terraform to control and set up our resources. However that doesn ´t mean that it is clear for everyone what to use and how to tie that together. Modularizing and documenting is key here. Also, we want to enable continuous integration here, so everyone can see what the effect would be of their changes, without giving everyone the necessary credentials to the whole stack. The rest of the team will look to you for advice on how to deploy their service, how to keep sight on its metrics and errors. Note that you are probably the one with the most knowledge, we do rotate on-call duties with the whole team. **Compensation** The envisioned salary range for this position is €55k-€70k per year (excluding 8% holiday pay), depending on experience. Besides that we offer Stock Appreciation Rights and a 4% learning budget. You’ll get an Apple Macbook Pro (M1) to work on. **About You** As important as coding itself however is your attitude towards colleagues and learning. We are looking for someone who is eager to improve, not too shy to ask any type of question and who can communicate well in writing. The reason for this is that we work remotely a lot (we did quite so before corona, but now practically 100%). You are eager to solve complex problems in a sustainable and pragmatic way. You don’t shy away from calling out possible pitfalls or infeasible plans. On the other hand you are also solution oriented, and helpful towards people who don’t understand code.

We’ve made a strong case for how and why audiences and society benefit when solutions journalism is integrated into the news — and we’ve had real success. We’ve worked with over 600 news organizations and 25,000 individual journalists and, based on growing demand for our work, currently staff are working across the United States as well as in Africa and Europe. Around the world, solutions reporting is being adopted by news organizations because it increases audience trust and engagement, sharpens accountability and can open up new sources of revenue. xa0 Today we believe it is more urgent than ever that we take bold action and significantly broaden our reach. Building on our foundational work with newsrooms, we are embarking upon an ambitious new strategy aimed at advancing a system-level change across the field of journalism, in which strong communications will play a critical role. Working with a core group of journalists, educators and allies, we aim to engage tens of thousands more along with hundreds of news organizations in a movement to ensure ready access to news that is informed by solutions reporting. Our vision of success is sweeping but achievable. With broad adoption of solutions journalism, we envision an increase in society’s capacity to solve problems, widespread reach of more complete and accurate coverage, advances in fairness and equity in reporting and a public that is actively involved in the stories being told about their communities. xa0 xa0 As solutions journalism leads a systems-level change in the media landscape, we are looking for a Media Researcher to deliver an in-depth report including recommendations on how we can leverage key partners, platforms, and innovations to disseminate effective responses towards social problems to a larger and more diverse group of people. xa0We are looking for someone who has a familiarity with and/or previous experience conducting media landscapes or other kinds of media research, as well as a pulse on the new media scene, ideally with connections to and knowledge of what’s working (and why) and best practices xa0The researcher will conduct a digital media analysis in order to identify patterns and recommendations for viable media platforms and innovations to scale solutions journalism, with an eye for reaching underserved audiences. The report will include an analysis of the landscape, visuals representing mapping of key players, and defining characteristics of each individual/ partner/ tool based on criteria to be developed in collaboration with the director of communications. Do you have skills or experiences that we haven’t thought of that you can bring to this job? Tell us how you can see this role benefit from your own individual experiences. We’re an energetic, ambitious, and fun bunch, and we want great people to join us. Equity, Justice, Diversity and Inclusion at SJN means a workplace where individual differences are recognized, appreciated, respected and responded to in ways that fully develop and utilize each person’s talents and strengths. Diversity of perspective, identity, and experience is important to us. xa0 We want to reflect and serve the whole of society. As a result, we encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds to seek employment, and we make all employment decisions without regard to race, age, gender, sexual orientation, or any other factors protected by federal, state or local law. To request reasonable accommodation, contact Eva Blanc, email xa0protected SJN Application & Hiring Process FAQ Q: Where’s the best place to learn more about the Solutions Journalism Network and the work that you do? A: Start with this “brief but spectacular” video made for PBS and featuring David Bornstein, one of SJN’s co-founders. Check out the SJN website, new research on how audiences respond to solutions journalism, our most recent survey of our newsroom partners and this study on how solutions journalism can lead to increased revenue. xa0 Q: Where do I submit my cover letter? A: The SJN application does not include a cover letter. Instead, we ask a series of questions that we hope will provide the opportunity for you to share your thoughts. All applicants respond to the same questions, which removes the guesswork of a cover letter and enables you to focus on the things we’re most interested in knowing about your qualifications for this role. (note: after the application questions, you will see a final box that says ADDITIONAL INFORMATION and the preview text says add a cover letter or anything else you want to share”. Please do not upload a cover letter here. If you have additional information that you would like to share with us that you didn’t include in your application responses you can use this space to do so. xa0 Q: The job description says this position is remote does that mean I can work from home? A: Yes. This position can be done from anywhere in the United States. The Solutions Journalism Network has its office in New York City (when we get back to the office!), but about half of our staff are based elsewhere. We would love for this position to join us in our office when we return. Q: Under benefits in the job description you mention a technology stipend. How does that work? A: SJN staffers provide their own cell phones, laptops and other technology. To help cover the cost, SJN provides each staffer with an annual stipend. Q: What happens after I submit my application? A: Once the application period closes, a team of SJN staffers will review all of the applications and contact candidates who move to the next stage of the process, which will include 1-2 rounds of interviews and, possibly, an additional (brief) assignment. #Location New York, NY See more jobs at Solutions Journalism Network´",[],https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK,70000,120000,95000.0,3,Year,4,,full-time,True,True,True,conversational,1

Moving forward, the biggest challenge we face is scaling our systems to work with large datasets and high system load.

Additionally, you will improve the performance of our main data store by adding or changing indexes as appropriate, adding caching functionality where possible and setting up monitoring to catch performance bottlenecks early on.

As a key member of our server-side team, you will specifically be expected to: * Design and build API endpoints for our internal and public APIs * Implement monitoring systems for performance bottlenecks on our main datastore * Determine through performance profiling, where to add caching to our distributed systems and internal interfaces * Monitor the growth of our datasets and assist in creating strategies to address the systems where growth could become an issue * Write effective high-quality code with a focus on performance and maintainability * Create reliable tests and work closely with our QA team for end-to-end testing Experience Requirements: * Mid-level/Senior * You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment. You will not be micro- managed, no fixed work hours, and no in-office requirements. It is important that you manage your time well, and you know what you need to do your job well (e.g., what work hours to pick so you have enough time to communicate with team members effectively) * Knowledge of the OOP paradigm, experience with functional programming, and other approaches is a plus * Experience building complex systems with many moving parts, such as different protocols, varying restrictions on latency or CAP parameters * Experience building and maintaining CI/CD systems is a bonus * Excellent knowledge of static type systems and compiled languages * Knowledge of various data stores such as SQL, document stores, key-value stores, or queuing systems, as well as their performance characteristics and scalability issues * Good understanding of caching and cache invalidation strategies Interested?

HEAD OF MARKETING @ FUN ECOM CO GREAT PEOPLE & CULTURE,JLS TRADING CO.,Worldwide,2022-01-10 20:38:22+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/108123-remote-head-of-marketing-fun-ecom-co-great-people-culture-jls-trading-co,"JLS Trading Co. JLSTradingCo.com Apply now 1,863 views 297 applied (16%) JLS Trading Co. is hiring a Remote Head of Marketing @ Fun Ecom Co Great People & Culture - Could you sell hair care products to Patrick Stewart - Do you nerd out on the latest online marketing techniques? - Do you love helping your team learn and grow? - Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense? If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is. We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me. **--Is this a real job ad?--** Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 80ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people. Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal): http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ And check out our reviews on Google, Glassdoor, or Indeed to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool. **--What do you guys do?--** Our business involves taking random products and then marketing the heck out of them, primarily on Amazon. We have hundreds of SKUs at the moment and are launching around 10-20 new products every single month. A small sampling: - Bad Parking Cards (http://amzn.com/B01HLGZRCQ) - Cable Tie Mounts (http://amzn.com/B06XNBS6TG) - K2-D3 Capsules (http://amzn.com/B07C451MZ9) We want to launch as many products as we can. Our business is growing rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth. **--What is your company like?--** 1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers. 2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest. 3. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it. 4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done. 5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. 6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you. 7. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here. 8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be? 9. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier. 10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it. 11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor. **--What are your company’s values?--** See here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us. **--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--** No. **--Wait. What?--** OK fine. **--So, what will I actually be doing?--** Super short version: We basically don’t have a marketing department, which I’m sure you’ll agree is pretty silly for a $16m E-Commerce company. We have a lot of pretty cool products, and more on the way, and we need you to put these products in front of the right audience, so that we can sell more of them! Here is a bulleted list of responsibilities: - Figure out what marketing channels we should be selling through - Prove that we can profitably sell through those channels - Build systems so that you aren’t the one doing the day-to-day operation of those channels - Build a team of marketers to scale to do the same/similar process on all of our existing catalogs and the new products in the pipeline - Scale your department as the company scales This is effectively building a marketing department from scratch, which has a lot of pros but also cons. If you want the freedom to build as you see fit, this is the position for you. Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed. It is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills. **--Do I need experience?--** Yes. This is not an entry level position. You are going to de-facto be an executive in the company and need to have relevant experience doing this and managing people. **--Do I need a college degree?--** You just need to be awesome. **--What marketing do you currently do?--** We just throw things onto Amazon with PPC and hope for the best. It’s worked OK to this point, but we could be 2-3x bigger with proper marketing. **--Is there a team in place?--** We have some junior marketers who are sorta/kinda doing stuff, but nothing serious. Mostly light activities on Amazon. **--Do you have budget?--** Yes, within reason. We’re definitely not gonna be doing a Superbowl ad anytime soon, but I also fully intend to spend money to make this work. **--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--** Haha - you sound just like my parole officer! **--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--** Please submit your information on the following page to apply: https://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/oHp1wmmdNH/Marketing-Director-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No. There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I´m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us. Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder). Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon! ---- JLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

QUALITY ASSURANCE DEVELOPER ENGINEER WITH PHP JAVASCRIPT AND SQL,DEFIANT,Worldwide,2022-01-10 17:55:20+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/107238-remote-qa-dev-engineer-with-php-js-and-sql-defiant,"Defiant defiant.com Apply now 3,750 views 868 applied (23%) Defiant is hiring a Remote Quality Assurance Developer Engineer With PHP JavaScript and SQL ## Description Defiant is hiring a QADev Engineer. Please note that this is not an automation role. We are hiring QA Analysts that have the ability to program in PHP and Javascript, and have a strong interest not just in finding bugs, but looking at code to determine why they exist, and occasionally dropping in a quick fix to continue testing. The salary range for this role is $90,000 to $120,000 with full benefits. It includes a no-strings-attached $15,000 dollar hiring bonus on your first paycheck. We are confident you’ll love working at Defiant and being a part of our amazing team, and our signing bonus reflects that. At Defiant, we have broken down the traditional wall that exists between Dev and QA. Our QA team is more technical than most and spends time not just finding, reproducing, and logging bugs, but actually diagnosing the underlying cause and providing an unusual amount of detail to our dev team to help them quickly implement a fix. For this role, you need to be able to read and write PHP and Javascript code along with SQL. Our hiring process will include a technical portion that will evaluate your ability to not only find and report bugs but to determine what the underlying cause of a bug is. If you are currently in a QA role that is not as technical as you’d like, and you want to get your hands dirty looking at PHP and JS code, tracing execution, diving into the database, and diagnosing the underlying cause of an issue, then this role may be perfect for you. Much like the DevOps role broke down the wall between the operations team and the development team, we have broken down the wall between QA and Dev by creating a role that we are calling “QADev”. This job is 100% remote. You can work from anywhere as long as you have bandwidth. We do most of our calls voice only, and we also use push-to-talk so you can operate in noisy environments like a coffee shop, while traveling, or with kids around. We are looking for individuals who don’t just do the minimum. Our team tries harder, goes further, digs deeper, pushes technology beyond its customary boundaries. WordPress powers 40% of the web, and we are the leaders in WordPress security. Compromise or complacency is not an option for us. Our core hours are from 10am – 1pm Pacific Time, Monday through Friday. In general, we want our team to be available during that time, but we’re a realistic company, we understand that life happens, and we’re outcome-focused. So as long as you’re doing a great job and getting things done, we are flexible. ## Requirements At Defiant we have one core value, and that is “Trust”. We trust that you’ll do a great job working remotely, be available during our core hours, and once you run out of work, find other ways to contribute. We don’t micro-manage and we don’t continuously monitor our team or their productivity. If you love QA, are passionate about your job, are productive, and can help the team ship great software, you’ll be very successful at Defiant. The specific skills we require for this position are: * Experience testing complex web applications is required. * Experience testing LAMP applications is preferred. * Mid-level PHP programming ability and use of dev tools required. * Mid-level Javascript programming ability and use of dev tools is required. * Experience working with a bug tracking system like Fogbugz, JIRA, or similar is required. * SQL knowledge is required. * AWS experience is preferred. * A passion for testing applications and shipping robust software is a must. This is a quality assurance role, not a developer role. ## Hiring Process All positions require a trial period of approximately 3 weeks with a minimum commitment of 10 hours per week. You will be paid for this short-term contract, and it will be used to evaluate whether both parties want to pursue an ongoing, regular employment relationship. All offers of employment are contingent on the successful completion of a background check. The results of the background check are considered as they relate to the position and do not automatically disqualify someone from an offer of employment with the company. ## Benefits * $15,000 one time hiring bonus. * Full time telecommuting and flexible working hours, with a company that has been 100% remote for over 8 years. * 100% employee premium and 50% of dependent premium paid by company for premier- level medical, dental, and vision insurance. * 21 days PTO per year to start. * Approximately 12 paid company holidays including the week from December 25 to January 1. * 401(k) with a 4% Safe Harbor company match that is 100% vested immediately. * Latest in laptop and workstation technology. * Wellness reimbursement program for health and fitness purchases. * Mobile phone and internet reimbursement up to $100 per month. * Monthly beverage reimbursement for coffee, tea, water, etc. * Paid training and study time for work-related training and certifications. * College tuition and Student Loan reimbursement. ## Diversity at Defiant We value diversity and do not discriminate based on race, color, religion or creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, age, physical or mental disability, military or veteran status, gender identity or expression, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, economic status, parental status, or any other non-performance-related status.

We are a digital-first freight forwarder using a mix of technology and exceptional service to help companies seamlessly move products across the Americas, starting with the biggest trade lane in the world: Mexico USA cross-border trucking. **The opportunity for you** As a Nuvocargo software engineer, you will work with senior members of the engineering and product organization. You will help architect and implement solutions up and down the stack from our front end apps, to our backend API, to our databases and external services. You will also be part of the landing team that will kickstart our engineering presence in Mexico City. As part of that team you ´ll help set a high quality bar for engineering and help us bring software best-practices from Silicon Valley to Mexico, making a meaningful impact to the startup ecosystem in Latin America. Together with rest of the engineering, product, design organization, you will help shape the future of Nuvocargo ´s tech stack and engineering culture. Our current stack includes a combination of modern tooling and philosophies: - The front end interfaces include React (including Context and Hooks), Next.js and interactive interfaces via the WhatsApp Business API interfaces and emails. - Our React/Jamstack apps are continuously deployed on Netlify and the internal team workflows and interfaces use a mix of low-code and no-code solutions (think: Airtable, Retool and Zapier) for fast iteration combined with custom front ends for usability, precision and control on certain workflows. - The design and styling processes for our frontend interfaces include Zeplin.io and a component library hosted in React Styleguidist. - We use Rails API, a Postgres database and API integrations with multiple external services for back end development. - We have a strong culture of building quickly and iteratively, deploying features and releases to staging and production multiple times a day. The products you build will be used by hundreds of Nuvocargo ´s customers, carriers and users across Nuvocargo ´s internal teams. **Who you are** - You love deploying features. One of your favorite feelings is shipping code and releasing new features to users. You know when to accrue technical debt in order to get a feature live. You strive for simple, readable code and you are averse to over-engineering the task at hand (YAGNI). - You have a track record of building great software in fast-growing companies. You have battle scars and wisdom from many years of building software in ever-changing environments. That wisdom comes both from projects that were incredibly successful and from projects that were abject failures. - You are passionate about making an impact in the Latin American startup ecosystem. You want to have a direct impact in establishing Nuvocargo ´s engineering org as one that bridges the gaps between Silicon Valley startups and the Latin American startup ecosystem. - 1 + 1 = 3. You strongly believe that collaboration, pairing, mentoring and raising the bar for everyone on the team makes the team greater than the sum of its parts. - You are a software craftsperson who believes in the journey to mastery. You believe in creating well crafted software, steadily adding value to stakeholders (as well as the engineering team and your future self) and collaborating with others with an open mind and flexible opinions. You believe that the journey of mastering the craft of software never ends, but you love being along for the ride. - You thrive in a low-friction, light-process environment. We are not a meeting-heavy org. You are self-motivated to write great software, release great products, pair with team members all without spending hours deliberating whether something is 3 points or 5 points. - You are intellectually curious. You are probably a polyglot when it comes to programming languages (and natural languages), even if you don ´t have mastery over those other languages. You are always curious to dabble in a new library or framework or language and you analyze their high level pros and cons without even realizing it. - You are both a great communicator and listener. You are great at synthesizing inputs from different sources; you speak and write clearly, concisely, and with a structure that gets everyone on the same page when things feel messy. **Must haves** Fluent in English. At least three years of professional experience of developing and deploying production software. Professional experience in at least one dynamically typed language (JavaScript, Ruby, Python etc). Personally growth minded. **Nice to haves** Professional experience at a software startup. Expertise in JavaScript and Ruby (React + Rails, even better!). Experience mentoring people technically. Experience building APIs. **What we offer** -A unique & fun culture at the intersection of the freight and technology industries as well as between the USA and Latin American work cultures. -Above market salary, benefits, and a robust employee stock ownership program to make you an owner and partner of the business. -Remote-first location strategy and allows you to work from wherever. Hybrid office / work from home model that allows for flexibility and collaboration time in our -Polanco / New York City office. Beautiful modern Polanco office space that is perfect for collaboration. -A chance to join the ground floor of a well-funded, fast-growing startup that is modernizing a trillion dollar industry critical to the global economy. **More about Nuvocargo** International logistics is the multi-trillion dollar connective tissue of the world economy, but it ´s been slow to leverage the power of technology; it ´s finally going digital, and Nuvocargo is playing a big role in driving this historic shift. We believe that true expertise in logistics cannot be automated and is incredibly valuable; however, we think software and technology can give logistics professionals superpowers to help provide shippers with the best service, and make everyone ´s lives easier.

TECH LEAD WITH MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE,LIKVIDO,Worldwide,2022-02-01 12:09:53+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/108507-remote-tech-lead-with-management-experience-likvido,"Likvido likvido.dk Apply now 464 views 29 applied (6%) Share this job: Likvido is also hiring a: Backend Developer Likvido is hiring a Remote Tech Lead with Management Experience # Fully remote tech lead (.NET) with management experience for fast-growing fintech Hi , I hope you’re our next tech lead! Likvido is a 4-year old company with insanely big ambitions. We’re around 55 employees located around the world. We have customers in Denmark and in the UK, but the initial stretch goal is to become a European unicorn. The whole product team is remote-first, with people from many different nationalities - Denmark, Scotland, Spain, Italy, Russia … you name it. We’re a team with very high expectations, so we look for the best people anywhere. We’re not a “bullshit remote” company where it´s a “flexible remote”. You can either work from home, use our office in Copenhagen - or be a digital nomad traveling around. We honestly don’t care, as long as you live the life you want. We care about output & that’s it. **Who is Likvido?** We automate bookkeeping for thousands of customers. And before you run away screaming and thinking, “noooooo, how boring!”, just hear me out! Just think about it. Your first thought was, “wow, that´s xa0****ing boring” But how do you think our customers feel? You’re a tech person. You’re a nerd (like us!). After all, you got into development. You probably feel some pleasure in how structured accounting systems are, and you probably fantasized about how to implement double-entry bookkeeping architecture at one point in your life - amirite? Our customers are not nerds. They don’t think bookkeeping is cool. It’s super important for them, as it’s the foundation for both growth and not being closed by the government. That is why Likvido is so important: We let our customers focus on what they are passionate about. Whether it´s growing their business, spending more time with the family, or pursuing more hobbies - Likvido puts your accounting on autopilot! **How will we do it?** Very long story and this job post is already really long. But I can tell you that over the next few years, it means we have to build: - An accounting system - Deep integrations with a bank (signup with Likvido, you get a bank account) - Automate the bookkeeper If you’re looking for tech challenges? You’ve arrived at the right place! **Who are you and what are you supposed to do?** Huge ambitions are great, but if you don’t build it on a solid foundation, you’re xa0****ed. This role is responsible for building a solid foundation in your product team. We deeply care about building the proper infrastructure. That means making the right technical decisions, using the newest technologies, and consistently improving our platforms. We strive to use 25% of all development time on infrastructure and tech debt improvements. We also measure feature usage and take removing features very seriously, so we have fewer things to maintain. The core of this role is a tech-lead for our product team. Product teams in Likvido are typically 5-6 developers with a UX’er and a product manager in each team. As a tech-lead, you’re responsible for: - Reviewing pull requests from team members - Help with hiring and training developers - Help the product manager and UX’er break down epics - Prioritize the most critical tech debt or infrastructure problems - Participate in product planning sessions, to help the PM with ideas, feedback and feasibility input - Participate in cross-team sessions with other tech leads, to discuss important architecture decisions - Have the final word for software architecture decisions within the team - Make sure the team follows the overall technical structures and paths we have set forth in Likvido - Implementing features (realistically, you spend 25-50% of your time in code) You xa0**must** xa0have management experience, as we see this role growing into an engineering manager down the road. As an engineering manager, developers would report directly to you. However, the job starts out as a tech lead and you will first talk about becoming an engineering manager when you’ve excelled at being a tech lead. **Your skillset:** To succeed in this role, you identify yourself as: - You’re a great .NET developer with what that entails in 2022 (obvious keywords: Azure & cloud experience, Kubernetes/Docker, .NET Core / .NET 6, Vue.js/React experience) - You have at least five years of professional development experience, but most likely, you’re closer to 8-10 years - You have experience both as a manager and tech-lead from prior companies - You’re a critical pragmatist. You understand when quick solutions are acceptable and even more critical when they are not. You’re not an extreme perfectionist (no need to build a perfect solution), but you’re also not a hacker (we cannot just hack things together) - You have good communication skills. You will attend business meetings, talk to customers (online) & present to the company. **Our tech stack** This is our tech-stack in keywords: - Webapp with VueJS frontend using the ´Backend-For-Frontend´ approach - Our API’s are running .NET 6 - Services are running on AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services) - Source code is hosted on Github, and Github Actions is used to deploy services to AKS - SQL Server and Azure Blobs for our data storage needs. - Our general architecture is to build bounded contexts, with several services and databases inside each context. The services are small and scalable, and we use both queues, event grids, and HTTP APIs for communicating between services. **Practicalities** - You will work 100% remote along with our existing team, but you are of course also welcome at the Copenhagen office as much as you want - Salary expectation between 85-100k EUR a year depending on experience - We work within CET office hours but are flexible to accommodate other schedules (especially if you’re a digital nomad and have shorter periods in funny places) - We pay very competitive salaries and are open to warrants for the right candidate - You’ll earn paid vacation days each month - We have a learning and development budget - We expect you to be fluent in English - The position is full-time - Your manager will be operating from Denmark Be sure to mention the word **VERSATILE** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Notes are time consuming and stressful to create while trying to hold a conversation. Even when done well, notes are a poor solution compared to hearing something first-hand. We started Fathom to rid us all of the tyranny of note-taking and in just over a year we’ve already accomplished a lot: * **#1 Zoom App** xa0on the new Zoom App Marketplace(https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps?category=zoom-apps) * **#1 Product of the Day and #5 Product of the Month** xa0for Dec 2021(https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fathom-2) * **4.9/5 Rating on G2** xa0- READ OUR REVIEWS(https://www.g2.com/products/fathom-2021-09-22/reviews) * **We’ve raised a $4.7M seed round**(https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/fathom-raises-3-7m-for-its-ai-notetaker/) from a number of great investors including notable tech CEOs (Twitch, Reddit, Cruise, Clearbit, People.ai), early Zoom investors, and even Zoom itself. * **We’re hitting usage records every week** Check out our product(https://fathom.video) (it’s free) and/or our 90 second demo video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuzs0xkXo3U) to learn more about the product. ### WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN US After a year of heads down building, we’re looking to add a couple senior full-stack engineers to our 5 person engineering team so we can ship even faster. We assume that you’re experienced and great at what you do so let’s instead tell you about us and what you can expect if you join us: * __We’re smart and GSD (get shit done).__ You’ll work alongside our 5-person, all-senior engineering team (3 PhDs and 1 Masters in Computer Science, plus a front-end guy who can sing karaoke). * __We embrace being fully remote.__ We schedule meetings sparingly and instead heavily use async comms (Slack, Notion, Loom) * __Opportunity for impact.__ We’re established enough to be able to ship instead of fight fires but also early enough enough that your work will have a real impact. * __Experienced management.__ You’ll work closely with our CEO who is a 2X Founder/CEO (previously started UserVoice) and who has a background in Computer Science as well as product design. * __Great comp.__ We only want the best so we provide great salaries, generous equity, and full benefits. We don’t adjust your salary based upon where you happen to live. ### ABOUT OUR HIRING PROCESS * __No live coding.__ We have no idea who thought writing code on whiteboards was a good idea but we hate it. We’re much more interested in what you’ve done and learned. * __You’ll meet the entire team.__ We think it’s important that you get to meet everyone you’ll be working with. * __No bullshit.__ Ask us anything you like. We’ve never understood why companies pretend they’re something that they’re not in the hiring process - you’re going to find out eventually so we’d rather you know who we are up front so we can both make sure this is a good fit for all involved. * __Quick turnaround time.__ We know you have lots of options so we move fast usually in less than a week from start to finish. ### TECH STACK We use all of the following technologies. Your knowledge of these would be helpful but you need not be familiar with all of them. _GKE, S3, Ruby/Rails/Sidekiq, Go, Electron, Typescript/TSX, Stencil, Elasticsearch, C++, Kafka, MySQL, Redis, Pusher, GitHub Actions, Docker, ArgoCD, CircleCI_ ### HARD REQUIREMENTS Outside of the obvious technical skills, GSD mindset, and ability to thrive in a remote environment we do have a few hard requirements that you should be aware of: * Must speak English fluently * We’re open to international hires but you must be based in a time zone close to those of the mainland US. * You must have a number of years of production experience under your belt.

EF CAPITAL INVESTMENT ADVISOR,EMPIRE FLIPPERS,Worldwide,2022-01-24 00:00:02+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/108266-remote-ef-capital-investment-advisor-empire-flippers,"´Empire Flippers Apply now 4,711 views 182 applied (4%) Empire Flippers is also hiring a: Finance Administrator Customer Advisor Migration Advisor Content Specialist EF Capital Project Manager Empire Flippers is hiring a Remote EF Capital Investment Advisor We are looking to bring on another talented hire to join our EF Capital team starting March 28th, 2022. While the role will require you to put in some hours during US time zones, the role itself is location independent, allowing you to work and live anywhere in the world. Whether it ´s a beach in Bali, the side-streets of Tokyo, or a villa in Mexico -- the choice is yours. We ´re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters, excited about building a new division of an established, exciting internet company. You ´ll help build this new venture from the ground up, but with the guidance and expertise of a management team who ´s already done it successfully. You ´ll be plugging into a network of business professionals who invest, buy, and run successful, profitable internet companies. You ´ll be working with other driven professionals and mentored by a management team that truly wants to bring the best out in you. The industry is going through a period of explosive growth and our company is on the bleeding edge of investing in online businesses. This new asset class has been exploding in recent years and we need your help to scale. This is the position we wished we had when we were starting out! A remote position in a kick-ass remote company that works and plays hard. Ready to get started? If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position! **So What is an Investment Advisor?** An Investment Advisor is a sales professional who works directly with portfolio managers (operators) and investors on the EF Capital platform. You will be responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with online entrepreneurs who want to operate portfolios for EF Capital. You will also be responsible for working with existing and new investors who wish to passively invest in online businesses. This includes explaining EF Capital terms, processes, and the benefits of working with us. The person in this role must love talking with people. If you ´re selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it ´s a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Investment Advisor. **What ´s the Opportunity?** Becoming an Investment Advisor will put you in a critical role at EF Capital. You ´ll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment. The work will be challenging and you may find yourself wearing several different hats along the way. While we have the support and backing of a larger established company and brand, it ´s not wrong to say this will compare closely to a rapidly growing startup in the financial services sector. You won ´t be another cog in the wheel of some larger corporation. You won ´t be employee #30492 looking to skate by and hope that your peers or supervisor can cover for you. You ´ll be an absolutely critical player in a company with big expectations and opportunity. Your work ethic and skill-set will have a direct impact on our growth. You ´ll gain access to our Rolodex, receive direct training, mentorship and support, and gain valuable insights into the online business space that no course could ever teach you. You ´ll be working right away with savvy investors, successful entrepreneurs running dozens or hundreds of sites, and portfolio owners and management teams running global product brands. Do you want a seat at the table? A real shot to be a leader and have a voice in a fast-growing industry? If we ´re a good fit for each other, that ´s exactly what you ´ll get with this position. **What ´s This Investment Advisor Position Like?** While you can expect to work hard and wear many different hats, we ´re not terribly corporate. Empire Flippers has been an INC 5000 company for a number of years, but we ´re completely bootstrapped, have no board to answer to, and are focused on results, not politics. You ´ll find much of the same at EF Capital. When you first come on board as an Investment Advisor, you will start learning more about our industry before jumping into the job. First you will learn about the different types of online businesses available for sale on Empire Flippers. Then you will learn about EF Capital. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how investments are structured down to intricacies of business acquisitions. Once you have the basics down, you will use the phone, chat systems, and email to communicate with our customers and will have access to our backend support systems through HubSpot, Zendesk, and our custom software platform. You might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you ´re up and going? Here is a list of daily tasks we ´ll expect from you (not exhaustive and subject to change): - Take calls with potential operators and answering their questions on how we structure investment deals and how they can participate - Call potential investors who have expressed interest in investing and guiding them to the next step in our sales funnel - Return emails to potential operators or investors who are looking at using our platform, but still have questions about our process - Work closely with our team to improve marketing based on your conversations with investors and operators xa0 - Figure out ways to improve our existing process to make it a better experience for both investors and operators **What Skills Are Needed?** We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with. However, that doesn ´t mean we aren ´t looking for a certain kind of skill-set. While no previous work experience is needed, experience in sales is a big plus. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don ´t have that experience, don ´t let it stop you from applying. You must love talking with people. You need to be able to pick up the phone and call someone who doesn ´t know you and see how they are doing. This isn ´t cold-calling, everyone you call will have expressed some interest in working with EF Capital and have given out their phone number, so they will be familiar with the company. It is your task to make sure they understand our processes and see why we are someone they want to work with. You can spot risks and opportunities. Every day, you will speak with investors and entrepreneurs about scaling businesses, liabilities, and how good certain assets are as an investment. Over time, you will need to be able to spot genuine risks and opportunities with online businesses. You will need to be able to confidently tell the entire story behind each potential investment opportunity. While investing in online businesses can bring great returns, it can also be a volatile space to play in. We take a consultative approach with customers. We ´re not trying to fit square pegs into round holes. We truly believe that the best sales experience includes transparency -- which sometimes means letting the customer know why they shouldn ´t do the deal. Having that confidence will allow you to be that much more effective and persuasive when the right customer is looking at the right deal. Along those lines, we respect our audience ´s intelligence by telling them about both the risks and rewards. You ´re a problem solver. Investing in these businesses can be a very important decision and a very intimate experience for entrepreneurs and operators on the other side of the deal. That means you will face obstacles and challenges. It will be up to you to make sure those challenges are met head-on and solved for all parties in the deal. You ´re excited about expanding the EF Capital brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us. **What ´s the Lifestyle Like?** Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! We aren ´t going to chain you to a cubicle. You ´ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves you best. The choice is yours. You won ´t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our investors and operators. We typically require all new hires to work in-person with their manager for the first 3-6 months to get up to speed quickly and create a close knit group. After that, employees are free to live anywhere in the world. Due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, xa0**we are not making this a requirement**. We will offer an optional 2-month in-person training in either Medellin, Colombia or Phuket, Thailand with the EF Capital Team. Again, attending this in-person training is optional and won ´t be a hiring requirement. Our company holds biannual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. Our meetups were on hold for 2020, but in 2021 we were able to gather together again as a team for a fun filled week in Las Vegas! For the first 6 months, you will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. After 6 months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan and will have paid, international healthcare coverage. Within 12 months, you can expect to be earning $60,000 -- $80,000 USD per year depending on performance. With this being a new venture, there is a lot of opportunity to move into management roles with significantly higher pay. **Love It. What ´s the Catch?** We love our team and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table. We love to play and travel. A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work awfully hard. Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you ´re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the world. Sometimes we really do work next to the beach. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil with a 12-hour work day through the night. That isn ´t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a client ´s series of questions, so you ´ll need to be prepared for that. A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job. We want you to become a long-term employee with us. Ultimately, we want this position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company. Also we ´re looking for people who can step into management roles as the company grows. **The Details to Keep in Mind** Remember, we ´re not going to throw you into the fire right away. As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later working more independently. Our team will review every application that comes our way. If you ´re a good fit, we will schedule an interview. Typically, we do two rounds of interviews before we decide. The cut-off date for applying is January 28th. xa0 Applications will be reviewed as they come in so apply early. Expected start date is March 28th. If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role. **How Do I Apply?** Here is the sequence of events we use when hiring our new team members: 1. You record a YouTube video* explaining who you are and why you ´re a good fit for the position, fill out an application, and submit it by January 28, 2022. 2. We review submissions and schedule interviews in early February. 3. Second interviews are done mid February, and a final decision is made. 4. The chosen applicant will be announced with a start date of March 28th, 2022. *YouTube Video Requirements: We will only accept submissions that include a YouTube URL. Please leave the video unlisted in preferences and share the link with us. The quality of the video doesn ´t matter, and there are no bonus points for editing. We simply want (up to) three minutes of you explaining (based on your previous experience): 1. Why this position is an excellent fit for you and us 2. Why you think you ´re a good fit to work with our prospective customers If you ´re thinking about applying, but are worried you might not have enough (*insert excuse here*) --- don ´t worry. If you want to build something more than just a 9-to-5 job, then click the apply button below. **We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not apply.** **A background check is required. xa0** Be sure to mention the word **GREAT** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

You´ll also be involved in collaborations with other areas of the business - for example integrating Ghost(Pro) with billing and support systems. All our infrastructure is managed and deployed through config management and supported by a lot of custom code - so being comfortable with git and software development (Node/Python) is important. Our infrastructure comprises more than 100 servers across two datacenters, running Ubuntu and managed with Saltstack, sitting behind a fairly deep CDN integration. Most common tech across our instances includes MySQL, Varnish, OpenResty/Nginx, LXC, Gluster, and a lot of Node.js. This role includes responsibility for being part of an on-call rota that includes weekends and holiday cover, but the team spans multiple timezones so incident management responsibilities typically follow the sun. All infrastructure roles at Ghost are inclusive of on-call responsibilities, and we do our best to be as flexible and open to working with everyone´s schedules. ## Skills and experience - Strong experience with automation as a core skill - Experience and confidence in managing, deploying and maintaining complex projects across several different environments - Experience specifically relating to web hosting at scale, containerisation and continuous delivery - Exceptionally clear communication, especially when identifying and responding to infrastructure failures - Managing infrastructure requirements and optimisations based on app performance and user load scenarios - Distributed systems, database clustering and replication management - Platform monitoring and observability - Backup and DR planning, plus common security issues and mitigation strategies ## Who you are **Confidently independent.** xa0 All teams at Ghost operate fairly autonomously, and all team members are responsible for helping make decisions about what needs to be done. **An active collaborator.** xa0 We look for people who actively want critical feedback on their work early and often, and who get a kick out of refining and pushing what they do as a collaborative process because it creates a better end result. **Meticulous about quality.** xa0 Quality matters a great deal in everything we do, whether that´s engineering, content or design — we care about creating things which we´re proud of. **A clear communicator.** xa0 As a remote team which communicates almost exclusively through writing — concise, written communication is essential. Humble but opinionated. We enjoy working with smart people who have lots of ideas, yet are happy to discard their former opinions whenever a better way of doing things presents itself We don´t mind where you´re based or what hours you work, but this role requires some working-hours overlap with the rest of our infrastructure team, based between Europe and Australia. We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.

Node.js experience is important, because that´s what Ghost is written in! Ember.js experience is a big advantage, too. Experience working with other parts of our stack is a bonus, particularly Bookshelf, Knex, Express and Handlebars. A good grasp of MySQL and SQLite3 are helpful too, but not essential. Any other experience with startups, SaaS, open source, distributed applications or remote work is also very valuable. One of the major perks of engineering at Ghost is that almost every single thing you work on will be released as open source under the MIT license. So you’re not just writing code for us, you’re writing it for yourself and for everyone else - both now, and in the future. Instead of spending years doing work will eventually be locked away in a box labelled “intellectual property” — you´ll get to write code which is open for anyone to use, including you in your own future projects! People who are great at written communication and highly self-motivated tend to do best at Ghost. The majority of our team is made up of former founders, freelancers and self-starters who are confident and comfortable working independently and getting things done. This role would be well suited to someone who is experienced at building/shipping products, looking for a big/interesting thing to work on with a great international team and a healthy work/life balance. Our culture at Ghost is one of calm, happy work. Not a frantic startup treadmill. Maybe you’re overworked at a traditional tech company and uncomfortable with the level of resemblance your life bears to an episode of HBO’s Silicon Valley. Or maybe you’ve been solo bootstrapping products for years and you´re ready to work on something bigger with a group of excited, likeminded people.

We will review all applications. # What is Subscribie? **Subscribie** xa0automates recurring payment collection. It was built out of a frustration of manually doing payments in the UK, and a system was setup to automate payments. It allows small businesses to xa0***quickly*** xa0and xa0**cost-effectively, collect recurring payments** xa0for the services or products they sell on subscription. These businesses may or may not be primarily online (e.g. a fitness coach, a wine club, rugby club, software company selling licences). Despite being xa0**fully bootstrapped,** xa0 xa0**Subscribie has already been proven useful** xa0in automating payments, and is helping local sports clubs spend more time with their teammates, restaurants stay open during covid with wine subscriptions, and software companies collect recurring payments for their software. Practially; Not just based on our own years of payments experience, we emphasise and talk to our customers regularly to improve our service. The objective we iterate on is (paradoxically), to identify the manual tasks and automate them as Subscribie runs in the background. # Why do you need me? We need you to help us be a voice so that more established businesses discover Subscribie, start using it, and free up their time away from invoices and away from the drudgery of manual. # What ´s our why? We care are saving people time- we think time in-front of a computer should be a choice not a chore. Large businesses already automate much of their payment processes, we ´re bringing that to every small business so that nobody needs to ask have you sent the attachment? ever again. **Our Narrow vision statement**: Subscribie automates recurring payments for your business. **Our Broad 5 years vision statement**: Subscribie safely eliminates all manual payment tasks saving thousands of hours every week, with automated payment and collection of payments due (subscriptions/invoices) with zero fees direct between banks. # What is the job? You ´re primary responsibility is to apply your skills in marketing to get additonal established businesses to sign-up and start using Subscribie. We ´re open to your expertise. Here ´s some of the things we already have which you might want to expand on with your marketing - Online chat - Organic blog - Adwords - Analytics - Goal tracking - Business and Socials # Why don ´t you just hire a short term freelancer? At the moment we value longer term engagements over one-off short campaigns. Yes we want results (who doesn ´t?) but right now we ´re looking to grow something meaningful. # How we work - We don ´t mind when you work, unless working together and respecting it ´s valuable to work together instead of alone sometimes (it ´s a great way to learn from each other too) - We promote autonomy - We promote psychological safety - This means feeling 100% safe saying I don ´t know, I broke something without fear - Cultivate learning - Favor collaborative documentation over passing conversations Asynchronous communication is a must, and habitually send links, and all context required since we occasionally communicate across timezones.

Who we are Process Street is a no-code workflow platform startup from San Francisco. We help our customers build, document, automate, and track recurring workflows. Our platform stores knowledge where the action happens, ensuring thorough and error free execution of workflows that our global customers run their businesses on. Our mission is to make recurring work fun, fast, and faultless for teams everywhere We service over 3k customers around the world, such as Airbnb, Spotify, AstraZeneca, and Accenture, and are VC-backed by Accel, Salesforce, and Atlassian. Process Street was founded on a strong belief in the work-life benefits of a healthy, collaborative remote culture. We value flexibility because many of us are parents, travelers, or just creatives who aren ´t inspired by the construct of a mundane 9-to-5. Spread across 9 different time zones, we communicate asynchronously, work autonomously, and take real ownership of our work. We know human connections are what make teams strong, so we regularly do coffee chats, game-playing, story-telling, and more to build connections. If you’re entrepreneurial and seek an environment that values impact, ownership and flexibility we look forward to meeting you! The Opportunity The Head of Design is responsible for partnering closely with Product and Marketing Leaders to set the design vision across all customer touch-points, raise the visual and interaction design quality, and get cross functional teams working cohesively. As the owner of Process Street’s overall design strategy, you will also steer creative direction ensuring a consistent vision across all customer touch-points from branding, to sales materials, to the product itself. You will be responsible for developing and evangelizing a design system and practice that pairs with the Shape UP methodology. You will develop the standards and guidelines which clarify the expectations of our design strategy and guide the team through its implementation. You will perform quantitative and qualitative research to identify improvement and new feature opportunities, whilst ensuring company wide transparency on Brand and Product Design evolution. About You * You want agency. We practice the Shape Up process, and run 6-week cycles and 2-week cooldowns. For the 6-week cycles, PMs provide a problem statement and some guidelines – no tickets, no detailed specs, no hi-fidelity solutions, and no estimates. Designers and engineers are trusted to craft the best solution possible in the cycle using user research, data, experience, and grit. During the 2-week cooldowns, you have the autonomy to work on what ´s important to you. If a lot of responsibility, freedom, and ambiguity sounds refreshing, this role is for you. * You value collaboration. You know that understanding the constraints and viewpoints of your peers across engineering, product, and design results in a better user experience. If you find yourself actively seeking out the opinion of engineers, for example, you ´re probably a strong candidate for this role. * You love process, but loathe bureaucracy and ceremony. We think process is a tool. Used well, it makes us a better, faster team. But when it ´s not doing that, we drop it. We also avoid unnecessary meetings whenever possible. A typical week for our engineers and designers has fewer than 5 hours of meetings. * You love to ship. We move fast. We deploy continuously behind feature flags, and release to customers at the end of every cycle. This is a hands-on role. You ´ll be designing a lot, and seeing your designs shipped to production daily. * You want to have a big impact. We ´re a small team and we ´re still early stage. We don ´t have designated areas of responsibility, and everyone wears the product hat. Every cycle brings new challenges, and your sphere of influence is wide. You love the variety and don ´t want to be shackled to a single project for years. * You ´re well-versed in design thinking, design systems, and modern design software. You ´ve led design sprints. You enjoy using tools like Figma, Miro, and Storybook to collaborate with your peers in real-time. And you ´re excited to maintain and contribute to a design system. * You have five or more years of experience in product design. While the job posting notes the role as a Head of Design, we will hire in a range of levels for this position. So if the role excites you, and you have five years of experience, but don ´t have a Lead or Head title, you should apply. Our Favourite Perks * Fully remote – No offices, no commute, check-in from a destination of your choosing! * Unlimited Time Off – Most take 3-4 weeks, plus recognition of days or events of their choosing. * End of Year Shutdown - A company-wide week off to reflect and recharge. * Annual Company Offsite - On pause during the Pandemic, but we still sponsor small group meetups – safely and responsibly – to meet each other and build connective tissue. * Health and Wellness - Generous health insurance for US-based employees and their families * Stock Options - Live by a Process Street value and “Act like an owner” by participating in our ESOP For applicants based in Colorado the minimum salary for this opportunity is $150,000 + equity + benefits.

Distributors sell nearly every physical good you come across. Key to the economy, they make up over 28% of GDP. But there’s a problem. Selling as a distributor is complicated. They carry hundreds of thousands of complicated products, making it impossible for sales teams to know what their customers need. Proton cuts through this complexity with machine learning. We provide a solution that modernizes distributors´ sales efforts. And in doing so, we help distributors better serve their customers and grow. Our company is in hyper-growth mode. We´ve had significant year-over-year revenue growth, and we just raised a $20M Series A(https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/18/proton-ai-raises-20m-to-optimize-wholesale-distributors-sales-operations/) backed by Felicis Ventures(https://www.felicis.com/) (investors in Twitch, Shopify, Opendoor, and many others) and Battery Ventures(https://www.battery.com/). Needless to say, it’s an exciting time to join the Proton.ai team. **The Role** At Proton, we´re bringing cutting-edge machine learning to B2B distribution. By predicting what customers will buy, we´re improving sales and efficiency, and driving growth. Of course, we have to do this in a smart, scalable way, and take steps not to overload the user with data. Our goal is to make things easier for our users to be effective with minimal effort on their part, not to create a new Excel. As a Backend Engineer, you´ll work with our Python and Go code to improve the workflows of distribution sales reps. You´ll have access to our growing backend group across the company, working across our different products. You´ll also have access to actual users to workshop your features, too. We´re looking for someone high-potential we can build, nurture, and support in their career, and take along for an exciting startup adventure. **What you´ll do:** * Work with UX designers, product managers, and frontend engineers to help devise, design, build, and revise new features. * You´ll achieve this through collaborating with your team to deliver a seamless, performant experience across the web and mobile device * Collaborate with data scientists to deliver thoughtful features powered by cutting-edge machine learning models. **Experience that may be helpful:** * Our backend code is written in Python and Go, deployed using a microservice architecture * You will need some familiarity with big data and deploying scalable and tested code, but specific knowledge of Python or Go is not required **Benefits** This is a full-time, fully-remote position, with occasional paid travel to in-person meetups. It includes a salary of $110,000 to $155,000 (US, depending on level, with different bands for Europe and Asia), plus equity, health benefits (we pay 99%), 401k and a generous vacation policy. We´re a remote-first company and open to candidates around the world. For this hire, we are looking for someone located in the Americas or who is willing to commit to working permanently on a US timezone. **Our Hiring Process** As you may have noticed, our hiring process is a little different. At Proton.ai, we assess candidates using an unbiased and thoughtful process. We ask questions directly related to the work you will be doing. Resumes are optional. They are not the focus of our selection process. You can read more about that(https://blog.dev.proton.ai/hiring/2020/12/11/we-hire-differently.html) — and learn more about our engineering organization more generally — on our engineering blog(https://blog.dev.proton.ai/).

We ´ve seen the xa0research xa0that women and other people in underrepresented groups tend to only apply when the checklist is all ticks and no crosses. So if this role resonates with you, hit that apply button! About The Job As a Corporate Platform Engineer on the new IT & Corporate Engineering team, you’ll build sustainable, elegant solutions to complex problems across the business, helping every team at Linktree. Our team mission is to remove the “work about work” and deliver delightful and engaging experiences to everyone at Linktree. xa0 You’ll automate things where you can, and you’ll partner with other teams to help solve their technology problems, and serve as an owner of the platforms and services we use here at Linktree. You’ll build and manage the systems our IT Ops team supports and our Linktree team uses to get their jobs done every day. You’ll be hands on, sometimes writing code or scripts, with commercial or open-source solutions. You’ll also find a way to say yes to difficult asks, and be a visible member of the team. You’ll be one of the first members of this team, which means you’ll be building many things from scratch, or rebuilding existing systems in a better way. Your primary focus will be building systems and services, managing them, and planning out how they’ll evolve as we grow. We’re growing fast, so this means you’ll need to be flexible while the team scales, and help with operations tasks, as well as mentor the IT Operations team (who will be one of your primary customers.) Because we’re a startup, this means there’s sometimes a lack of structure, so you’ll need to love solving problems and figuring out who to work with, or independently, and reacting without all the answers. If you’re looking for clearly defined structure, this might not be a great fit for you. If you’re excited about building that structure, then read on! We know that experience and skills can be related to the opportunities you’ve had in your career, and every person is different. If you have some of these skills but not all, please apply and let us know why you’re amazing, and why you’re a great fit. We’d love to talk. Where & How We Work We are a global, diverse group across age, gender, and race and offer a truly flexible and family friendly work environment. Kids, pets, and the occasional delivery person are all actively encouraged to appear on our Zoom screens. All of us at Linktree work either fully remote or a hybrid remote, but in-office sometimes approach and that will continue even when COVID is behind us. We currently have offices in Melbourne, Sydney, LA coming next, but our team is spread across Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, USA, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. Being globally distributed doesn ´t mean working to one timezone and we offer autonomy and flexibility in how you structure your days and weeks. There will be the need for some collaboration outside of a normal 9-5 being a global company, but we aim to work asynchronously where possible. Our Culture & Benefits Linktree ´s company culture and values are based around collaboration, diversity, inclusion, and flexibility. Those are all nice words but to give you some more specific examples: - We recognise that each person is unique and have designed our benefits with this in mind. Each person has $6000 AUD to spend across Wellness, Growth, Lifestyle, and Impact pillars. This could be gym memberships, courses, childcare, pet insurance, holidays, or green energy initiatives. - We have a paid 18-week xa0parental leave program xa0that is inclusive of birth and non-birthing parents and supports the whole parenting lifecycle. - We are proud to offer all regular full-time and part-time employees 20 hours ´ paid volunteering leave per calendar year. - Flexibility is at the core of Linktree, so whether you prefer fully remote, the office, or a bit of both, the choice is up to you. We trust you to get the work done. - We have several diversity and inclusion initiatives underway, including a D&I council, training for all staff on neurodiversity, unconscious bias, and the incorporation of a transpositive inclusion policy. - We prioritise our team ´s mental health, with all employees having free access to Headspace and xa0Uprise, including 1:1 coaching sessions from qualified psychologists or counsellors. - All Linktree staff receive $1000 AUD towards setting up their work from home space.

While the role will require you to put in some hours during US time zones, the role itself is location independent, allowing you to work and live anywhere in the world. Whether it ´s a beach in Bali, the side-streets of Tokyo, or a villa in Mexico -- the choice is yours. We ´re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters, excited about building a new division of an established, exciting internet company. You ´ll help build this new venture from the ground up, but with the guidance and expertise of a management team who ´s already done it successfully. You ´ll be plugging into a network of business professionals who invest, buy, and run successful, profitable internet companies. You ´ll be working with other driven professionals and mentored by a management team that truly wants to bring the best out in you. The industry is going through a period of explosive growth and our company is on the bleeding edge of investing in online businesses. This new asset class has been exploding in recent years and we need your help to scale. This is the position we wished we had when we were starting out! A remote position in a kick-ass remote company that works and plays hard. Ready to get started? If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position! **So What is an Investment Advisor?** An Investment Advisor is a sales professional who works directly with portfolio managers (operators) and investors on the EF Capital platform. You will be responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with online entrepreneurs who want to operate portfolios for EF Capital. You will also be responsible for working with existing and new investors who wish to passively invest in online businesses. This includes explaining EF Capital terms, processes, and the benefits of working with us. The person in this role must love talking with people. If you ´re selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it ´s a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Investment Advisor. **What ´s the Opportunity?** Becoming an Investment Advisor will put you in a critical role at EF Capital. You ´ll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment. The work will be challenging and you may find yourself wearing several different hats along the way. While we have the support and backing of a larger established company and brand, it ´s not wrong to say this will compare closely to a rapidly growing startup in the financial services sector. You won ´t be another cog in the wheel of some larger corporation. You won ´t be employee #30492 looking to skate by and hope that your peers or supervisor can cover for you. You ´ll be an absolutely critical player in a company with big expectations and opportunity. Your work ethic and skill-set will have a direct impact on our growth. You ´ll gain access to our Rolodex, receive direct training, mentorship and support, and gain valuable insights into the online business space that no course could ever teach you. You ´ll be working right away with savvy investors, successful entrepreneurs running dozens or hundreds of sites, and portfolio owners and management teams running global product brands. Do you want a seat at the table? A real shot to be a leader and have a voice in a fast-growing industry? If we ´re a good fit for each other, that ´s exactly what you ´ll get with this position. **What ´s This Investment Advisor Position Like?** While you can expect to work hard and wear many different hats, we ´re not terribly corporate. Empire Flippers has been an INC 5000 company for a number of years, but we ´re completely bootstrapped, have no board to answer to, and are focused on results, not politics. You ´ll find much of the same at EF Capital. When you first come on board as an Investment Advisor, you will start learning more about our industry before jumping into the job. First you will learn about the different types of online businesses available for sale on Empire Flippers. Then you will learn about EF Capital. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how investments are structured down to intricacies of business acquisitions. Once you have the basics down, you will use the phone, chat systems, and email to communicate with our customers and will have access to our backend support systems through HubSpot, Zendesk, and our custom software platform. You might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you ´re up and going? Here is a list of daily tasks we ´ll expect from you (not exhaustive and subject to change): - Take calls with potential operators and answering their questions on how we structure investment deals and how they can participate - Call potential investors who have expressed interest in investing and guiding them to the next step in our sales funnel - Return emails to potential operators or investors who are looking at using our platform, but still have questions about our process - Work closely with our team to improve marketing based on your conversations with investors and operators xa0 - Figure out ways to improve our existing process to make it a better experience for both investors and operators **What Skills Are Needed?** We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with. However, that doesn ´t mean we aren ´t looking for a certain kind of skill-set. While no previous work experience is needed, experience in sales is a big plus. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don ´t have that experience, don ´t let it stop you from applying. You must love talking with people. You need to be able to pick up the phone and call someone who doesn ´t know you and see how they are doing. This isn ´t cold-calling, everyone you call will have expressed some interest in working with EF Capital and have given out their phone number, so they will be familiar with the company. It is your task to make sure they understand our processes and see why we are someone they want to work with. You can spot risks and opportunities. Every day, you will speak with investors and entrepreneurs about scaling businesses, liabilities, and how good certain assets are as an investment. Over time, you will need to be able to spot genuine risks and opportunities with online businesses. You will need to be able to confidently tell the entire story behind each potential investment opportunity. While investing in online businesses can bring great returns, it can also be a volatile space to play in. We take a consultative approach with customers. We ´re not trying to fit square pegs into round holes. We truly believe that the best sales experience includes transparency -- which sometimes means letting the customer know why they shouldn ´t do the deal. Having that confidence will allow you to be that much more effective and persuasive when the right customer is looking at the right deal. Along those lines, we respect our audience ´s intelligence by telling them about both the risks and rewards. You ´re a problem solver. Investing in these businesses can be a very important decision and a very intimate experience for entrepreneurs and operators on the other side of the deal. That means you will face obstacles and challenges. It will be up to you to make sure those challenges are met head-on and solved for all parties in the deal. You ´re excited about expanding the EF Capital brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us. **What ´s the Lifestyle Like?** Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! We aren ´t going to chain you to a cubicle. You ´ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves you best. The choice is yours. You won ´t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our investors and operators. We typically require all new hires to work in-person with their manager for the first 3-6 months to get up to speed quickly and create a close knit group. After that, employees are free to live anywhere in the world. Due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, xa0**we are not making this a requirement**. We will offer an optional 2-month in-person training in either Medellin, Colombia or Phuket, Thailand with the EF Capital Team. Again, attending this in-person training is optional and won ´t be a hiring requirement. Our company holds biannual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. Our meetups were on hold for 2020, but in 2021 we were able to gather together again as a team for a fun filled week in Las Vegas! For the first 6 months, you will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. After 6 months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan and will have paid, international healthcare coverage. Within 12 months, you can expect to be earning $60,000 -- $80,000 USD per year depending on performance. With this being a new venture, there is a lot of opportunity to move into management roles with significantly higher pay. **Love It. What ´s the Catch?** We love our team and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table. We love to play and travel. A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work awfully hard. Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you ´re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the world. Sometimes we really do work next to the beach. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil with a 12-hour work day through the night. That isn ´t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a client ´s series of questions, so you ´ll need to be prepared for that. A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job. We want you to become a long-term employee with us. Ultimately, we want this position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company. Also we ´re looking for people who can step into management roles as the company grows. **The Details to Keep in Mind** Remember, we ´re not going to throw you into the fire right away. As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later working more independently. Our team will review every application that comes our way. If you ´re a good fit, we will schedule an interview. Typically, we do two rounds of interviews before we decide. The cut-off date for applying is January 28th. xa0 Applications will be reviewed as they come in so apply early. Expected start date is March 28th. If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role. **How Do I Apply?** Here is the sequence of events we use when hiring our new team members: 1. You record a YouTube video* explaining who you are and why you ´re a good fit for the position, fill out an application, and submit it by January 28, 2022. 2. We review submissions and schedule interviews in early February. 3. Second interviews are done mid February, and a final decision is made. 4. The chosen applicant will be announced with a start date of March 28th, 2022. *YouTube Video Requirements: We will only accept submissions that include a YouTube URL. Please leave the video unlisted in preferences and share the link with us. The quality of the video doesn ´t matter, and there are no bonus points for editing. We simply want (up to) three minutes of you explaining (based on your previous experience): 1. Why this position is an excellent fit for you and us 2. Why you think you ´re a good fit to work with our prospective customers If you ´re thinking about applying, but are worried you might not have enough (*insert excuse here*) --- don ´t worry. If you want to build something more than just a 9-to-5 job, then click the apply button below. **We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not apply.** **A background check is required. xa0** Be sure to mention the word **GREAT** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

You´ll also be involved in collaborations with other areas of the business - for example integrating Ghost(Pro) with billing and support systems. All our infrastructure is managed and deployed through config management and supported by a lot of custom code - so being comfortable with git and software development (Node/Python) is important. Our infrastructure comprises more than 100 servers across two datacenters, running Ubuntu and managed with Saltstack, sitting behind a fairly deep CDN integration. Most common tech across our instances includes MySQL, Varnish, OpenResty/Nginx, LXC, Gluster, and a lot of Node.js. This role includes responsibility for being part of an on-call rota that includes weekends and holiday cover, but the team spans multiple timezones so incident management responsibilities typically follow the sun. All infrastructure roles at Ghost are inclusive of on-call responsibilities, and we do our best to be as flexible and open to working with everyone´s schedules. ## Skills and experience - Strong experience with automation as a core skill - Experience and confidence in managing, deploying and maintaining complex projects across several different environments - Experience specifically relating to web hosting at scale, containerisation and continuous delivery - Exceptionally clear communication, especially when identifying and responding to infrastructure failures - Managing infrastructure requirements and optimisations based on app performance and user load scenarios - Distributed systems, database clustering and replication management - Platform monitoring and observability - Backup and DR planning, plus common security issues and mitigation strategies ## Who you are **Confidently independent.** xa0 All teams at Ghost operate fairly autonomously, and all team members are responsible for helping make decisions about what needs to be done. **An active collaborator.** xa0 We look for people who actively want critical feedback on their work early and often, and who get a kick out of refining and pushing what they do as a collaborative process because it creates a better end result. **Meticulous about quality.** xa0 Quality matters a great deal in everything we do, whether that´s engineering, content or design — we care about creating things which we´re proud of. **A clear communicator.** xa0 As a remote team which communicates almost exclusively through writing — concise, written communication is essential. Humble but opinionated. We enjoy working with smart people who have lots of ideas, yet are happy to discard their former opinions whenever a better way of doing things presents itself We don´t mind where you´re based or what hours you work, but this role requires some working-hours overlap with the rest of our infrastructure team, based between Europe and Australia. We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds.

Node.js experience is important, because that´s what Ghost is written in! Ember.js experience is a big advantage, too. Experience working with other parts of our stack is a bonus, particularly Bookshelf, Knex, Express and Handlebars. A good grasp of MySQL and SQLite3 are helpful too, but not essential. Any other experience with startups, SaaS, open source, distributed applications or remote work is also very valuable. One of the major perks of engineering at Ghost is that almost every single thing you work on will be released as open source under the MIT license. So you’re not just writing code for us, you’re writing it for yourself and for everyone else - both now, and in the future. Instead of spending years doing work will eventually be locked away in a box labelled “intellectual property” — you´ll get to write code which is open for anyone to use, including you in your own future projects! People who are great at written communication and highly self-motivated tend to do best at Ghost. The majority of our team is made up of former founders, freelancers and self-starters who are confident and comfortable working independently and getting things done. This role would be well suited to someone who is experienced at building/shipping products, looking for a big/interesting thing to work on with a great international team and a healthy work/life balance. Our culture at Ghost is one of calm, happy work. Not a frantic startup treadmill. Maybe you’re overworked at a traditional tech company and uncomfortable with the level of resemblance your life bears to an episode of HBO’s Silicon Valley.

Notes are time consuming and stressful to create while trying to hold a conversation. Even when done well, notes are a poor solution compared to hearing something first-hand. We started Fathom to rid us all of the tyranny of note-taking and in just over a year we’ve already accomplished a lot: * **#1 Zoom App** xa0on the new Zoom App Marketplace(https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps?category=zoom-apps) * **#1 Product of the Day and #5 Product of the Month** xa0for Dec 2021(https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fathom-2) * **4.9/5 Rating on G2** xa0- READ OUR REVIEWS(https://www.g2.com/products/fathom-2021-09-22/reviews) * **We’ve raised a $4.7M seed round**(https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/fathom-raises-3-7m-for-its-ai-notetaker/) from a number of great investors including notable tech CEOs (Twitch, Reddit, Cruise, Clearbit, People.ai), early Zoom investors, and even Zoom itself. * **We’re hitting usage records every week** Check out our product(https://fathom.video) (it’s free) and/or our 90 second demo video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuzs0xkXo3U) to learn more about the product. ### WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN US After a year of heads down building, we’re looking to add a couple senior full-stack engineers to our 5 person engineering team so we can ship even faster.

We don’t adjust your salary based upon where you happen to live. ### ABOUT OUR HIRING PROCESS * __No live coding.__ We have no idea who thought writing code on whiteboards was a good idea but we hate it. We’re much more interested in what you’ve done and learned. * __You’ll meet the entire team.__ We think it’s important that you get to meet everyone you’ll be working with. * __No bullshit.__ Ask us anything you like. We’ve never understood why companies pretend they’re something that they’re not in the hiring process - you’re going to find out eventually so we’d rather you know who we are up front so we can both make sure this is a good fit for all involved. * __Quick turnaround time.__ We know you have lots of options so we move fast usually in less than a week from start to finish. ### TECH STACK We use all of the following technologies. Your knowledge of these would be helpful but you need not be familiar with all of them. _GKE, S3, Ruby/Rails/Sidekiq, Go, Electron, Typescript/TSX, Stencil, Elasticsearch, C++, Kafka, MySQL, Redis, Pusher, GitHub Actions, Docker, ArgoCD, CircleCI_ ### HARD REQUIREMENTS Outside of the obvious technical skills, GSD mindset, and ability to thrive in a remote environment we do have a few hard requirements that you should be aware of: * Must speak English fluently * We’re open to international hires but you must be based in a time zone close to those of the mainland US. * You must have a number of years of production experience under your belt.

If you don´t have a stellar track record of success due to lack of opportunity but have high aptitude and the drive/ambition to work hard to achieve similar level of throughput as your teammates, we´re open to it! Interviews We appreciate that interviews are an investment of your time and emotions. Every step of the interview, from application to offer, you´ll hear back within 24 hour tops. If the onsite requires you take PTO from your current job, we´ll pay you for the day. If we decide not to move forward after an interview, we´ll let you know the concrete feedback to help you with your search, not a canned response. Interviews are 1. 30 min phone chat with an engineer (we just round robin). 2. pair programming session on Zoom, 3. hangout and do some more programming and discussions with us for a day. No algorithms. If you´re past 3, you can optionally 4. interview us.

EF CAPITAL INVESTMENT ADVISOR,EMPIRE FLIPPERS,Worldwide,2022-01-24 00:00:02+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/108266-remote-ef-capital-investment-advisor-empire-flippers,"´Empire Flippers Apply now 8,676 views 213 applied (2%) Share this job: Get a rok.co short link Empire Flippers is also hiring a: Content Specialist EF Capital Project Manager EF Capital Content Marketing Specialist Demand Generation Specialist Marketing Analytics Specialist Empire Flippers is hiring a Remote EF Capital Investment Advisor We are looking to bring on another talented hire to join our EF Capital team starting March 28th, 2022. While the role will require you to put in some hours during US time zones, the role itself is location independent, allowing you to work and live anywhere in the world. Whether it ´s a beach in Bali, the side-streets of Tokyo, or a villa in Mexico -- the choice is yours. We ´re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters, excited about building a new division of an established, exciting internet company. You ´ll help build this new venture from the ground up, but with the guidance and expertise of a management team who ´s already done it successfully. You ´ll be plugging into a network of business professionals who invest, buy, and run successful, profitable internet companies. You ´ll be working with other driven professionals and mentored by a management team that truly wants to bring the best out in you. The industry is going through a period of explosive growth and our company is on the bleeding edge of investing in online businesses. This new asset class has been exploding in recent years and we need your help to scale. This is the position we wished we had when we were starting out! A remote position in a kick-ass remote company that works and plays hard. Ready to get started? If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position! **So What is an Investment Advisor?** An Investment Advisor is a sales professional who works directly with portfolio managers (operators) and investors on the EF Capital platform. You will be responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with online entrepreneurs who want to operate portfolios for EF Capital. You will also be responsible for working with existing and new investors who wish to passively invest in online businesses. This includes explaining EF Capital terms, processes, and the benefits of working with us. The person in this role must love talking with people. If you ´re selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it ´s a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Investment Advisor. **What ´s the Opportunity?** Becoming an Investment Advisor will put you in a critical role at EF Capital. You ´ll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment. The work will be challenging and you may find yourself wearing several different hats along the way. While we have the support and backing of a larger established company and brand, it ´s not wrong to say this will compare closely to a rapidly growing startup in the financial services sector. You won ´t be another cog in the wheel of some larger corporation. You won ´t be employee #30492 looking to skate by and hope that your peers or supervisor can cover for you. You ´ll be an absolutely critical player in a company with big expectations and opportunity. Your work ethic and skill-set will have a direct impact on our growth. You ´ll gain access to our Rolodex, receive direct training, mentorship and support, and gain valuable insights into the online business space that no course could ever teach you. You ´ll be working right away with savvy investors, successful entrepreneurs running dozens or hundreds of sites, and portfolio owners and management teams running global product brands. Do you want a seat at the table? A real shot to be a leader and have a voice in a fast-growing industry? If we ´re a good fit for each other, that ´s exactly what you ´ll get with this position. **What ´s This Investment Advisor Position Like?** While you can expect to work hard and wear many different hats, we ´re not terribly corporate. Empire Flippers has been an INC 5000 company for a number of years, but we ´re completely bootstrapped, have no board to answer to, and are focused on results, not politics. You ´ll find much of the same at EF Capital. When you first come on board as an Investment Advisor, you will start learning more about our industry before jumping into the job. First you will learn about the different types of online businesses available for sale on Empire Flippers. Then you will learn about EF Capital. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how investments are structured down to intricacies of business acquisitions. Once you have the basics down, you will use the phone, chat systems, and email to communicate with our customers and will have access to our backend support systems through HubSpot, Zendesk, and our custom software platform. You might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you ´re up and going? Here is a list of daily tasks we ´ll expect from you (not exhaustive and subject to change): - Take calls with potential operators and answering their questions on how we structure investment deals and how they can participate - Call potential investors who have expressed interest in investing and guiding them to the next step in our sales funnel - Return emails to potential operators or investors who are looking at using our platform, but still have questions about our process - Work closely with our team to improve marketing based on your conversations with investors and operators xa0 - Figure out ways to improve our existing process to make it a better experience for both investors and operators **What Skills Are Needed?** We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with. However, that doesn ´t mean we aren ´t looking for a certain kind of skill-set. While no previous work experience is needed, experience in sales is a big plus. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don ´t have that experience, don ´t let it stop you from applying. You must love talking with people. You need to be able to pick up the phone and call someone who doesn ´t know you and see how they are doing. This isn ´t cold-calling, everyone you call will have expressed some interest in working with EF Capital and have given out their phone number, so they will be familiar with the company. It is your task to make sure they understand our processes and see why we are someone they want to work with. You can spot risks and opportunities. Every day, you will speak with investors and entrepreneurs about scaling businesses, liabilities, and how good certain assets are as an investment. Over time, you will need to be able to spot genuine risks and opportunities with online businesses. You will need to be able to confidently tell the entire story behind each potential investment opportunity. While investing in online businesses can bring great returns, it can also be a volatile space to play in. We take a consultative approach with customers. We ´re not trying to fit square pegs into round holes. We truly believe that the best sales experience includes transparency -- which sometimes means letting the customer know why they shouldn ´t do the deal. Having that confidence will allow you to be that much more effective and persuasive when the right customer is looking at the right deal. Along those lines, we respect our audience ´s intelligence by telling them about both the risks and rewards. You ´re a problem solver. Investing in these businesses can be a very important decision and a very intimate experience for entrepreneurs and operators on the other side of the deal. That means you will face obstacles and challenges. It will be up to you to make sure those challenges are met head-on and solved for all parties in the deal. You ´re excited about expanding the EF Capital brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us. **What ´s the Lifestyle Like?** Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! We aren ´t going to chain you to a cubicle. You ´ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves you best. The choice is yours. You won ´t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our investors and operators. We typically require all new hires to work in-person with their manager for the first 3-6 months to get up to speed quickly and create a close knit group. After that, employees are free to live anywhere in the world. Due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, xa0**we are not making this a requirement**. We will offer an optional 2-month in-person training in either Medellin, Colombia or Phuket, Thailand with the EF Capital Team. Again, attending this in-person training is optional and won ´t be a hiring requirement. Our company holds biannual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. Our meetups were on hold for 2020, but in 2021 we were able to gather together again as a team for a fun filled week in Las Vegas! For the first 6 months, you will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. After 6 months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan and will have paid, international healthcare coverage. Within 12 months, you can expect to be earning $60,000 -- $80,000 USD per year depending on performance. With this being a new venture, there is a lot of opportunity to move into management roles with significantly higher pay. **Love It. What ´s the Catch?** We love our team and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table. We love to play and travel. A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work awfully hard. Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you ´re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the world. Sometimes we really do work next to the beach. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil with a 12-hour work day through the night. That isn ´t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a client ´s series of questions, so you ´ll need to be prepared for that. A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job. We want you to become a long-term employee with us. Ultimately, we want this position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company. Also we ´re looking for people who can step into management roles as the company grows. **The Details to Keep in Mind** Remember, we ´re not going to throw you into the fire right away. As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later working more independently. Our team will review every application that comes our way. If you ´re a good fit, we will schedule an interview. Typically, we do two rounds of interviews before we decide. The cut-off date for applying is January 28th. xa0 Applications will be reviewed as they come in so apply early. Expected start date is March 28th. If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role. **How Do I Apply?** Here is the sequence of events we use when hiring our new team members: 1. You record a YouTube video* explaining who you are and why you ´re a good fit for the position, fill out an application, and submit it by January 28, 2022. 2. We review submissions and schedule interviews in early February. 3. Second interviews are done mid February, and a final decision is made. 4. The chosen applicant will be announced with a start date of March 28th, 2022. *YouTube Video Requirements: We will only accept submissions that include a YouTube URL. Please leave the video unlisted in preferences and share the link with us. The quality of the video doesn ´t matter, and there are no bonus points for editing. We simply want (up to) three minutes of you explaining (based on your previous experience): 1. Why this position is an excellent fit for you and us 2. Why you think you ´re a good fit to work with our prospective customers If you ´re thinking about applying, but are worried you might not have enough (*insert excuse here*) --- don ´t worry. If you want to build something more than just a 9-to-5 job, then click the apply button below. **We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not apply.** **A background check is required. xa0** Be sure to mention the word **GREAT** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

We know that not everyone fits into boxes and we are all always learning, however here are a few things that we are looking for: - Someone who is experienced in ReactJS and has a strong knowledge of JS fundamentals.

So we are looking for someone who is comfortable going through code reviews, knows or would like to learn about testing their code and make it more performant - We don’t care about university degrees, but we would like to see you have a good bit of theoretical knowledge in areas you have worked in and are interested in - Have good communication skills and be a team player who is happy to lend a hand if someone gets stuck - Someone who can roll up their sleeves and jump on different things. Building a simple online video editor isn’t always so simple, so you might work on WebGL, API, DevOps or Architecture stuff. You don´t need to know it all, but someone who is not scared of a challenge - Be able to contribute to the culture of engineering excellence by writing better documentation, teaching more junior teammates or improving processes around engineering in general - Experience working with video is a bonus Be sure to mention the word **EXQUISITELY** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

We’re building the next generation of hiring software that companies like Netflix, Atlassian, KPMG, and McGraw-Hill Education rely on to grow their teams. We´ve rethought the talent acquisition paradigm and are the innovation leaders in our space and looking for the right people to join us as we scale. xa0 We’re extraordinarily proud of the company we’ve built so far (not to mention humbled to be recognized as the #1 place to work in San Francisco, as well as a top workplace in the entire United States). Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage and we’ll continue investing in our “Leveroos” and people-first culture. xa0 xa0 THE OPPORTUNITY As an Engineer on our Product team, you’ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. In our growing engineering organization, you’ll be developing and shipping new features and updates to Lever’s product. You’ll be learning about our real-time web stack UI frameworks that help us deliver a beautiful and high quality solution to our customers. In addition, working on API´s and integrations to support our partners. You’ll work collaboratively with product managers and designers to drive the implementation and release of major features, and be a champion of best practices for writing well-tested, well-organized code. You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack—including our open source web framework, DerbyJS. You will exercise judgment in making tradeoffs between design and feasibility. You’ll engineer extension points to be scalable and resilient in a complex, single-page application. We believe that user-centric design ultimately leads to the best products, so we listen closely to our users, both external and internal. As an engineer on our close-knit, cross-functional team, you’ll be an active voice in shaping our product. Lever is constantly rolling out high-demand features and tackling ever greater challenges of scale. THE TEAM You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about minimizing downtime. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things--automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience--and we love sharing those passions with each other. Read about what our team values and why here. THE TECH STACK Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency. Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, TypeScript, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs. Read more about xa0The Lever Tech Stack xa0from our Software Engineer, Eric Hwang.

Notes are time consuming and stressful to create while trying to hold a conversation. Even when done well, notes are a poor solution compared to hearing something first-hand. We started Fathom to rid us all of the tyranny of note-taking and in just over a year we’ve already accomplished a lot: * **#1 Zoom App** xa0on the new Zoom App Marketplace(https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps?category=zoom-apps) * **#1 Product of the Day and #5 Product of the Month** xa0for Dec 2021(https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fathom-2) * **4.9/5 Rating on G2** xa0- READ OUR REVIEWS(https://www.g2.com/products/fathom-2021-09-22/reviews) * **We’ve raised a $4.7M seed round**(https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/fathom-raises-3-7m-for-its-ai-notetaker/) from a number of great investors including notable tech CEOs (Twitch, Reddit, Cruise, Clearbit, People.ai), early Zoom investors, and even Zoom itself. * **We’re hitting usage records every week** Check out our product(https://fathom.video) (it’s free) and/or our 90 second demo video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuzs0xkXo3U) to learn more about the product. ### WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN US After a year of heads down building, we’re looking to add a couple senior full-stack engineers to our 5 person engineering team so we can ship even faster. We assume that you’re experienced and great at what you do so let’s instead tell you about us and what you can expect if you join us: * __We’re smart and GSD (get shit done).__ You’ll work alongside our 5-person, all-senior engineering team (3 PhDs and 1 Masters in Computer Science, plus a front-end guy who can sing karaoke). * __We embrace being fully remote.__ We schedule meetings sparingly and instead heavily use async comms (Slack, Notion, Loom) * __Opportunity for impact.__ We’re established enough to be able to ship instead of fight fires but also early enough enough that your work will have a real impact. * __Experienced management.__ You’ll work closely with our CEO who is a 2X Founder/CEO (previously started UserVoice) and who has a background in Computer Science as well as product design. * __Great comp.__ We only want the best so we provide great salaries, generous equity, and full benefits. We don’t adjust your salary based upon where you happen to live. ### ABOUT OUR HIRING PROCESS * __No live coding.__ We have no idea who thought writing code on whiteboards was a good idea but we hate it. We’re much more interested in what you’ve done and learned. * __You’ll meet the entire team.__ We think it’s important that you get to meet everyone you’ll be working with. * __No bullshit.__ Ask us anything you like. We’ve never understood why companies pretend they’re something that they’re not in the hiring process - you’re going to find out eventually so we’d rather you know who we are up front so we can both make sure this is a good fit for all involved. * __Quick turnaround time.__ We know you have lots of options so we move fast usually in less than a week from start to finish. ### TECH STACK We use all of the following technologies. Your knowledge of these would be helpful but you need not be familiar with all of them. _GKE, S3, Ruby/Rails/Sidekiq, Go, Electron, Typescript/TSX, Stencil, Elasticsearch, C++, Kafka, MySQL, Redis, Pusher, GitHub Actions, Docker, ArgoCD, CircleCI_ ### HARD REQUIREMENTS Outside of the obvious technical skills, GSD mindset, and ability to thrive in a remote environment we do have a few hard requirements that you should be aware of: * Must speak English fluently * We’re open to international hires but you must be based in a time zone close to those of the mainland US. * You must have a number of years of production experience under your belt.

EF CAPITAL INVESTMENT ADVISOR,EMPIRE FLIPPERS,Worldwide,2022-01-24 00:00:02+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/108266-remote-ef-capital-investment-advisor-empire-flippers,"´Empire Flippers Apply now 8,684 views 213 applied (2%) Share this job: Get a rok.co short link Empire Flippers is also hiring a: Content Specialist EF Capital Project Manager EF Capital Content Marketing Specialist Demand Generation Specialist Marketing Analytics Specialist Empire Flippers is hiring a Remote EF Capital Investment Advisor We are looking to bring on another talented hire to join our EF Capital team starting March 28th, 2022. While the role will require you to put in some hours during US time zones, the role itself is location independent, allowing you to work and live anywhere in the world. Whether it ´s a beach in Bali, the side-streets of Tokyo, or a villa in Mexico -- the choice is yours. We ´re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters, excited about building a new division of an established, exciting internet company. You ´ll help build this new venture from the ground up, but with the guidance and expertise of a management team who ´s already done it successfully. You ´ll be plugging into a network of business professionals who invest, buy, and run successful, profitable internet companies. You ´ll be working with other driven professionals and mentored by a management team that truly wants to bring the best out in you. The industry is going through a period of explosive growth and our company is on the bleeding edge of investing in online businesses. This new asset class has been exploding in recent years and we need your help to scale. This is the position we wished we had when we were starting out! A remote position in a kick-ass remote company that works and plays hard. Ready to get started? If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position! **So What is an Investment Advisor?** An Investment Advisor is a sales professional who works directly with portfolio managers (operators) and investors on the EF Capital platform. You will be responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with online entrepreneurs who want to operate portfolios for EF Capital. You will also be responsible for working with existing and new investors who wish to passively invest in online businesses. This includes explaining EF Capital terms, processes, and the benefits of working with us. The person in this role must love talking with people. If you ´re selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it ´s a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Investment Advisor. **What ´s the Opportunity?** Becoming an Investment Advisor will put you in a critical role at EF Capital. You ´ll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment. The work will be challenging and you may find yourself wearing several different hats along the way. While we have the support and backing of a larger established company and brand, it ´s not wrong to say this will compare closely to a rapidly growing startup in the financial services sector. You won ´t be another cog in the wheel of some larger corporation. You won ´t be employee #30492 looking to skate by and hope that your peers or supervisor can cover for you. You ´ll be an absolutely critical player in a company with big expectations and opportunity. Your work ethic and skill-set will have a direct impact on our growth. You ´ll gain access to our Rolodex, receive direct training, mentorship and support, and gain valuable insights into the online business space that no course could ever teach you. You ´ll be working right away with savvy investors, successful entrepreneurs running dozens or hundreds of sites, and portfolio owners and management teams running global product brands. Do you want a seat at the table? A real shot to be a leader and have a voice in a fast-growing industry? If we ´re a good fit for each other, that ´s exactly what you ´ll get with this position. **What ´s This Investment Advisor Position Like?** While you can expect to work hard and wear many different hats, we ´re not terribly corporate. Empire Flippers has been an INC 5000 company for a number of years, but we ´re completely bootstrapped, have no board to answer to, and are focused on results, not politics. You ´ll find much of the same at EF Capital. When you first come on board as an Investment Advisor, you will start learning more about our industry before jumping into the job. First you will learn about the different types of online businesses available for sale on Empire Flippers. Then you will learn about EF Capital. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how investments are structured down to intricacies of business acquisitions. Once you have the basics down, you will use the phone, chat systems, and email to communicate with our customers and will have access to our backend support systems through HubSpot, Zendesk, and our custom software platform. You might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you ´re up and going? Here is a list of daily tasks we ´ll expect from you (not exhaustive and subject to change): - Take calls with potential operators and answering their questions on how we structure investment deals and how they can participate - Call potential investors who have expressed interest in investing and guiding them to the next step in our sales funnel - Return emails to potential operators or investors who are looking at using our platform, but still have questions about our process - Work closely with our team to improve marketing based on your conversations with investors and operators xa0 - Figure out ways to improve our existing process to make it a better experience for both investors and operators **What Skills Are Needed?** We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with. However, that doesn ´t mean we aren ´t looking for a certain kind of skill-set. While no previous work experience is needed, experience in sales is a big plus. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don ´t have that experience, don ´t let it stop you from applying. You must love talking with people. You need to be able to pick up the phone and call someone who doesn ´t know you and see how they are doing. This isn ´t cold-calling, everyone you call will have expressed some interest in working with EF Capital and have given out their phone number, so they will be familiar with the company. It is your task to make sure they understand our processes and see why we are someone they want to work with. You can spot risks and opportunities. Every day, you will speak with investors and entrepreneurs about scaling businesses, liabilities, and how good certain assets are as an investment. Over time, you will need to be able to spot genuine risks and opportunities with online businesses. You will need to be able to confidently tell the entire story behind each potential investment opportunity. While investing in online businesses can bring great returns, it can also be a volatile space to play in. We take a consultative approach with customers. We ´re not trying to fit square pegs into round holes. We truly believe that the best sales experience includes transparency -- which sometimes means letting the customer know why they shouldn ´t do the deal. Having that confidence will allow you to be that much more effective and persuasive when the right customer is looking at the right deal. Along those lines, we respect our audience ´s intelligence by telling them about both the risks and rewards. You ´re a problem solver. Investing in these businesses can be a very important decision and a very intimate experience for entrepreneurs and operators on the other side of the deal. That means you will face obstacles and challenges. It will be up to you to make sure those challenges are met head-on and solved for all parties in the deal. You ´re excited about expanding the EF Capital brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us. **What ´s the Lifestyle Like?** Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! We aren ´t going to chain you to a cubicle. You ´ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves you best. The choice is yours. You won ´t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our investors and operators. We typically require all new hires to work in-person with their manager for the first 3-6 months to get up to speed quickly and create a close knit group. After that, employees are free to live anywhere in the world. Due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, xa0**we are not making this a requirement**. We will offer an optional 2-month in-person training in either Medellin, Colombia or Phuket, Thailand with the EF Capital Team. Again, attending this in-person training is optional and won ´t be a hiring requirement. Our company holds biannual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. Our meetups were on hold for 2020, but in 2021 we were able to gather together again as a team for a fun filled week in Las Vegas! For the first 6 months, you will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. After 6 months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan and will have paid, international healthcare coverage. Within 12 months, you can expect to be earning $60,000 -- $80,000 USD per year depending on performance. With this being a new venture, there is a lot of opportunity to move into management roles with significantly higher pay. **Love It. What ´s the Catch?** We love our team and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table. We love to play and travel. A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work awfully hard. Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you ´re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the world. Sometimes we really do work next to the beach. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil with a 12-hour work day through the night. That isn ´t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a client ´s series of questions, so you ´ll need to be prepared for that. A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job. We want you to become a long-term employee with us. Ultimately, we want this position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company. Also we ´re looking for people who can step into management roles as the company grows. **The Details to Keep in Mind** Remember, we ´re not going to throw you into the fire right away. As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later working more independently. Our team will review every application that comes our way. If you ´re a good fit, we will schedule an interview. Typically, we do two rounds of interviews before we decide. The cut-off date for applying is January 28th. xa0 Applications will be reviewed as they come in so apply early. Expected start date is March 28th. If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role. **How Do I Apply?** Here is the sequence of events we use when hiring our new team members: 1. You record a YouTube video* explaining who you are and why you ´re a good fit for the position, fill out an application, and submit it by January 28, 2022. 2. We review submissions and schedule interviews in early February. 3. Second interviews are done mid February, and a final decision is made. 4. The chosen applicant will be announced with a start date of March 28th, 2022. *YouTube Video Requirements: We will only accept submissions that include a YouTube URL. Please leave the video unlisted in preferences and share the link with us. The quality of the video doesn ´t matter, and there are no bonus points for editing. We simply want (up to) three minutes of you explaining (based on your previous experience): 1. Why this position is an excellent fit for you and us 2. Why you think you ´re a good fit to work with our prospective customers If you ´re thinking about applying, but are worried you might not have enough (*insert excuse here*) --- don ´t worry. If you want to build something more than just a 9-to-5 job, then click the apply button below. **We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not apply.** **A background check is required. xa0** Be sure to mention the word **GREAT** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Today we are a team of around 100 amazing people advancing one of the hottest scale-up companies in the cybersecurity awareness training category, with locations in the United States, Finland and the United Kingdom. Hoxhunt is the fastest-growing software company in Finland, premiering at number 4 in the Deloitte Fast 50 rankings so we might just be the perfect choice for You! xa0 Hoxhunt educates employees on how to protect themselves and their employers against malicious cyberattacks. Our core belief is that the best way to do this is through frequent, personalized, and behavior-changing cybersecurity training. We have been featured in CIO Magazine, Forbes, Inc., EU-Startups, and many more publications. We have also been listed as one of the 10 hottest startups to work for in 2019 and developer students’ Top 10 Dream Employer in 2021 in Finland. We are now looking for a xa0Senior Digital Product Designer to join our Helsinki-based Design Team. You will be a member of the Product Design Team, and closely collaborate with Product Managers and our experienced Developers to create new experiences for our users, and value for our customers. We’ve created a unique twist to our training. Our platform is “serious gaming”: part game, part education, part simulation. This unique combination makes Hoxhunt a training platform our users love to engage with. But it also brings with it a tough set of design challenges that we hope you can help us with. For example: - how do we onboard new users, and help them quickly learn the basics? - how do we keep the training fresh and interesting for experienced users? - how can we turn data into useful report for our customers, for example about their risk levels? - how de we provide better self-service tools for our customers to manage and customise the training? - how do we better integrate with the other e-learning solutions our customers are using? Your key responsibilities will include - Gather input and ideas from colleagues and customers: what’s working well, what isn’t? - Work closely together with the product manager to define problems-worth-solving - Collaborate with a wide range of people to explore and sketch out potential UX concepts, and reach agreement on which concept to go for - Create high-fidelity UI designs and clickable mockups. Validate and iterate them. - Work in lock-step with the (frond-end) Devs so that every month the team can ship solutions we are immensely proud of - Expand the UI design toolkit and Design System xa0 What you will need as a Sr. Digital Product Designer - You have the ability to dive into an old problem or a new opportunity, and use a range of design methods to get to a workable design solution quickly - Along the way, you bring people together that can help find that solution, and make it happen. When you need someone to bounce off ideas with, you pro-actively reach out to them - You enjoy bringing in other people’s input for the design, organising reviews and managing the feedback. It’s a plus if you have experience running user research sessions - You have a great skillset when it comes to interaction and visual design - You are proficient in Figma (which is what we use) or similar tools - You look forward to working in a Design Team that is small but will likely be growing. You want to contribute to its development (coaching each other, expanding the Design System, improving our methodologies, etc.) - You have a strong track record in designing digital products - You are fluent in English Keen to see our design? Please feel free to take a look into our Dibbble-account https://dribbble.com/Hoxhunt or try out our demo at https://demo.hoxhunt.com If you have an up-to-date design portfolio, we’d love to see it. We expect it can give us a first impression of how you approach design challenges. If this is unreasonably difficult for you at the moment (for example if your recent work is under NDA, or if your current life situation makes it hard to spend the time) perhaps you can suggest an alternative way to show-case your way-of-working. Top reasons why you should join Hoxhunt - Impact. Cybersecurity is a “hot” industry. You get to design a product that defends companies from cybercrime, help support the cyber-skills training for 500.000+ everyday professionals, and make the world more cyber-secure. - Growth. Since 2016, the Hoxhunt family has grown from 4 founders to 90+ people - Personal development. We value professional growth, peer-support, and learning and support this in various ways - Culture. We have a strong company culture and care for our people. We promise you a fun but ambitious environment with lots of laughter. - Benefits. We offer fair compensation and equity option packages. All of our employees have extensive health care. The office has plenty of opportunities to work out, go for a swim, eat a healthy (or not so healthy) snack. - Flexibility. We have a cool office, but we also support remote working if you prefer (although we do think it’s important that you come to the office every now and then). Office hours are not set in stone. Getting the job done is what matters, not when or where it happens. xa0 Our Recruitment Process 1. Phone discussion with our Talent Acquisition team 2. Meeting with the Design Team lead and a Sr. Product Manager 3. Homework assignment related to your role. This should take about 2 hours, and it will be based on a purely fictional design challenge. Please let us know beforehand if you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process. 4. Team meeting and homework assignment review u202f 5. Reference checks If you are interested, please send us your details for example: LinkedIn / CV and portfolio. We will proceed with interviews right away, so be quick. #Salary and compensation No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to DevOps, Engineer, Senior and DevOps jobs that are similar: $70,000 — $120,000/year See more jobs at Hoxhunt´","['devops', 'engineer', 'senior', 'devops']",https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK,70000,120000,95000.0,3,Year,1,,full-time,True,True,True,conversational,1

Notes are time consuming and stressful to create while trying to hold a conversation. Even when done well, notes are a poor solution compared to hearing something first-hand. We started Fathom to rid us all of the tyranny of note-taking and in just over a year we’ve already accomplished a lot: * **#1 Zoom App** xa0on the new Zoom App Marketplace(https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps?category=zoom-apps) * **#1 Product of the Day and #5 Product of the Month** xa0for Dec 2021(https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fathom-2) * **4.9/5 Rating on G2** xa0- READ OUR REVIEWS(https://www.g2.com/products/fathom-2021-09-22/reviews) * **We’ve raised a $4.7M seed round**(https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/fathom-raises-3-7m-for-its-ai-notetaker/) from a number of great investors including notable tech CEOs (Twitch, Reddit, Cruise, Clearbit, People.ai), early Zoom investors, and even Zoom itself. * **We’re hitting usage records every week** Check out our product(https://fathom.video) (it’s free) and/or our 90 second demo video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuzs0xkXo3U) to learn more about the product. ### WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN US After a year of heads down building, we’re looking to add a couple senior full-stack engineers to our 5 person engineering team so we can ship even faster. We assume that you’re experienced and great at what you do so let’s instead tell you about us and what you can expect if you join us: * __We’re smart and GSD (get shit done).__ You’ll work alongside our 5-person, all-senior engineering team (3 PhDs and 1 Masters in Computer Science, plus a front-end guy who can sing karaoke). * __We embrace being fully remote.__ We schedule meetings sparingly and instead heavily use async comms (Slack, Notion, Loom) * __Opportunity for impact.__ We’re established enough to be able to ship instead of fight fires but also early enough enough that your work will have a real impact. * __Experienced management.__ You’ll work closely with our CEO who is a 2X Founder/CEO (previously started UserVoice) and who has a background in Computer Science as well as product design. * __Great comp.__ We only want the best so we provide great salaries, generous equity, and full benefits. We don’t adjust your salary based upon where you happen to live. ### ABOUT OUR HIRING PROCESS * __No live coding.__ We have no idea who thought writing code on whiteboards was a good idea but we hate it. We’re much more interested in what you’ve done and learned. * __You’ll meet the entire team.__ We think it’s important that you get to meet everyone you’ll be working with. * __No bullshit.__ Ask us anything you like. We’ve never understood why companies pretend they’re something that they’re not in the hiring process - you’re going to find out eventually so we’d rather you know who we are up front so we can both make sure this is a good fit for all involved. * __Quick turnaround time.__ We know you have lots of options so we move fast usually in less than a week from start to finish. ### TECH STACK We use all of the following technologies. Your knowledge of these would be helpful but you need not be familiar with all of them. _GKE, S3, Ruby/Rails/Sidekiq, Go, Electron, Typescript/TSX, Stencil, Elasticsearch, C++, Kafka, MySQL, Redis, Pusher, GitHub Actions, Docker, ArgoCD, CircleCI_ ### HARD REQUIREMENTS Outside of the obvious technical skills, GSD mindset, and ability to thrive in a remote environment we do have a few hard requirements that you should be aware of: * Must speak English fluently * We’re open to international hires but you must be based in a time zone close to those of the mainland US. * You must have a number of years of production experience under your belt.

Headquartered in Sacramento, California, we have since grown out of our previous 3 offices and many of our close to 180 employees are spread all across the United States. Those 180 employees support close to 300,000 users across 5,000 offices nationwide and now in Canada as well. Included in that is 8 out of the 15 largest Real Estate Brokerages in the nation. But, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. All of the growth and success that has happened is a result of us obsessing over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. We know this only happens by hiring people who don’t just come up with out of the box ideas but hiring people who actually see those ideas through and bring them to life. As we’ve grown, we’ve been fortunate enough to hire plenty of people who possess that quality and realize it’s equally important to hire people who can pair that skill with empathy, collaboration, and a keen sense of urgency.

We started by demystifying complicated tax credits, saving over $100M – and countless hours of tax code research – for founders in nearly every industry. Then, we introduced MainStreet Procurement, simplifying expense management and contract negotiation for teams without the means to do it themselves. Since our sort-of viral beginnings in 2019, we’ve raised a $60M Series A (more on that later), launched two product lines (with more in the works), and grew from 3 employees to 160+. We owe our success to the strength of our team. Before joining MainStreet, we helped build companies like Intuit, PayPal, Google, Apple, Gusto, LinkedIn, Slack, and more. We’re 100% remote, spanning across X states and Canada. We’re fellow founders, engineers, accountants, designers, dog (and cat) lovers, adventurers, coders, and parents. We move fast. We think big. We don’t take ourselves too seriously. And we’d love for you to join us. The Opportunity: MainStreet is looking for multiple Security Engineers to help us protect our systems and customer data. You’ll have an opportunity to contribute to the architecture and security stance underlying the platform that powers MainStreet’s product suite. You’ll be responsible for designing and implementing secure cloud architecture, security policy, and secure business practices. About MainStreet MainStreet takes a holistic approach to small business management so you can grow smarter, not harder. We plug into your accounting and payroll systems to check for savings opportunities in unlikely places. From complex government tax credits to exclusive discounts on the tools you use every day, we save you thousands of dollars, hundreds of hours, and countless headaches. Throughout the year, you’ll track expenses and savings through your MainStreet dashboard and tag us in on big purchases and contract negotiations. Come tax season, we’ll do the paperwork and even let your CPA take all the credit. Consider us your silent partner-in-savings, your financial secret weapon, your smart (not a) bank – whatever you want to call us. We’ve got your back so you can get back to building your business. Our $60M Series A We’ve raised over $60M from an incredible community of partners, operators, and founders, including SignalFire (who led our Series A), Ryan Hoover (Product Hunt founder), Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Des Traynor (Intercom co-founder), Gradient Ventures (a Google Venture Fund), Ron Conway’s fund SV Angel, Shrug Capital, and Tusk Ventures. How we think about diversity We try to make sure the diversity of our customers is reflected in the team that serves them. Because when we include people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, ages, and identities — we end up building a better experience for everyone who uses MainStreet. We know we need to be intentional in our hiring practices in order to overcome systemic biases we may be blind to. So, if your lived experience has given you a unique perspective on business, startups, or any other aspect of our business – even if you don’t meet all the requirements – please still apply and let us know so we can make sure your application gets the attention it deserves. #Salary and compensation No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to InfoSec and Engineer jobs that are similar: $80,000 — $130,000/year #Location Remote Position See more jobs at MainStreet´","['infosec', 'engineer']",https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK,70000,120000,95000.0,3,Year,4,,full-time,True,True,True,conversational,1

Today we are a team of around 100 amazing people advancing one of the hottest scale-up companies in the cybersecurity awareness training category, with locations in the United States, Finland and the United Kingdom. Hoxhunt is the fastest-growing software company in Finland, premiering at number 4 in the Deloitte Fast 50 rankings so we might just be the perfect choice for You! xa0 Hoxhunt educates employees on how to protect themselves and their employers against malicious cyberattacks. Our core belief is that the best way to do this is through frequent, personalized, and behavior-changing cybersecurity training. We have been featured in CIO Magazine, Forbes, Inc., EU-Startups, and many more publications. We have also been listed as one of the 10 hottest startups to work for in 2019 and developer students’ Top 10 Dream Employer in 2021 in Finland. We are now looking for a xa0Senior Digital Product Designer to join our Helsinki-based Design Team. You will be a member of the Product Design Team, and closely collaborate with Product Managers and our experienced Developers to create new experiences for our users, and value for our customers. We’ve created a unique twist to our training. Our platform is “serious gaming”: part game, part education, part simulation. This unique combination makes Hoxhunt a training platform our users love to engage with. But it also brings with it a tough set of design challenges that we hope you can help us with. For example: - how do we onboard new users, and help them quickly learn the basics? - how do we keep the training fresh and interesting for experienced users? - how can we turn data into useful report for our customers, for example about their risk levels? - how de we provide better self-service tools for our customers to manage and customise the training? - how do we better integrate with the other e-learning solutions our customers are using? Your key responsibilities will include - Gather input and ideas from colleagues and customers: what’s working well, what isn’t? - Work closely together with the product manager to define problems-worth-solving - Collaborate with a wide range of people to explore and sketch out potential UX concepts, and reach agreement on which concept to go for - Create high-fidelity UI designs and clickable mockups. Validate and iterate them. - Work in lock-step with the (frond-end) Devs so that every month the team can ship solutions we are immensely proud of - Expand the UI design toolkit and Design System xa0 What you will need as a Sr. Digital Product Designer - You have the ability to dive into an old problem or a new opportunity, and use a range of design methods to get to a workable design solution quickly - Along the way, you bring people together that can help find that solution, and make it happen. When you need someone to bounce off ideas with, you pro-actively reach out to them - You enjoy bringing in other people’s input for the design, organising reviews and managing the feedback. It’s a plus if you have experience running user research sessions - You have a great skillset when it comes to interaction and visual design - You are proficient in Figma (which is what we use) or similar tools - You look forward to working in a Design Team that is small but will likely be growing. You want to contribute to its development (coaching each other, expanding the Design System, improving our methodologies, etc.) - You have a strong track record in designing digital products - You are fluent in English Keen to see our design? Please feel free to take a look into our Dibbble-account https://dribbble.com/Hoxhunt or try out our demo at https://demo.hoxhunt.com If you have an up-to-date design portfolio, we’d love to see it. We expect it can give us a first impression of how you approach design challenges. If this is unreasonably difficult for you at the moment (for example if your recent work is under NDA, or if your current life situation makes it hard to spend the time) perhaps you can suggest an alternative way to show-case your way-of-working. Top reasons why you should join Hoxhunt - Impact. Cybersecurity is a “hot” industry. You get to design a product that defends companies from cybercrime, help support the cyber-skills training for 500.000+ everyday professionals, and make the world more cyber-secure. - Growth. Since 2016, the Hoxhunt family has grown from 4 founders to 90+ people - Personal development. We value professional growth, peer-support, and learning and support this in various ways - Culture. We have a strong company culture and care for our people. We promise you a fun but ambitious environment with lots of laughter. - Benefits. We offer fair compensation and equity option packages. All of our employees have extensive health care. The office has plenty of opportunities to work out, go for a swim, eat a healthy (or not so healthy) snack. - Flexibility. We have a cool office, but we also support remote working if you prefer (although we do think it’s important that you come to the office every now and then). Office hours are not set in stone. Getting the job done is what matters, not when or where it happens. xa0 Our Recruitment Process 1. Phone discussion with our Talent Acquisition team 2. Meeting with the Design Team lead and a Sr. Product Manager 3. Homework assignment related to your role. This should take about 2 hours, and it will be based on a purely fictional design challenge. Please let us know beforehand if you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process. 4. Team meeting and homework assignment review u202f 5. Reference checks If you are interested, please send us your details for example: LinkedIn / CV and portfolio.

Headquartered in Sacramento, California, we have since grown out of our previous 3 offices and many of our close to 180 employees are spread all across the United States. Those 180 employees support close to 300,000 users across 5,000 offices nationwide and now in Canada as well. Included in that is 8 out of the 15 largest Real Estate Brokerages in the nation. But, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. All of the growth and success that has happened is a result of us obsessing over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. We know this only happens by hiring people who don’t just come up with out of the box ideas but hiring people who actually see those ideas through and bring them to life. As we’ve grown, we’ve been fortunate enough to hire plenty of people who possess that quality and realize it’s equally important to hire people who can pair that skill with empathy, collaboration, and a keen sense of urgency.

We started by demystifying complicated tax credits, saving over $100M – and countless hours of tax code research – for founders in nearly every industry. Then, we introduced MainStreet Procurement, simplifying expense management and contract negotiation for teams without the means to do it themselves.

Come tax season, we’ll do the paperwork and even let your CPA take all the credit. Consider us your silent partner-in-savings, your financial secret weapon, your smart (not a) bank – whatever you want to call us. We’ve got your back so you can get back to building your business. Our $60M Series A We’ve raised over $60M from an incredible community of partners, operators, and founders, including SignalFire (who led our Series A), Ryan Hoover (Product Hunt founder), Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Des Traynor (Intercom co-founder), Gradient Ventures (a Google Venture Fund), Ron Conway’s fund SV Angel, Shrug Capital, and Tusk Ventures.

We’ve created a unique twist to our training. Our platform is “serious gaming”: part game, part education, part simulation. This unique combination makes Hoxhunt a training platform our users love to engage with. But it also brings with it a tough set of design challenges that we hope you can help us with. For example: - how do we onboard new users, and help them quickly learn the basics? - how do we keep the training fresh and interesting for experienced users? - how can we turn data into useful report for our customers, for example about their risk levels? - how de we provide better self-service tools for our customers to manage and customise the training? - how do we better integrate with the other e-learning solutions our customers are using?

It’s a plus if you have experience running user research sessions - You have a great skillset when it comes to interaction and visual design - You are proficient in Figma (which is what we use) or similar tools - You look forward to working in a Design Team that is small but will likely be growing.

Please feel free to take a look into our Dibbble-account https://dribbble.com/Hoxhunt or try out our demo at https://demo.hoxhunt.com If you have an up-to-date design portfolio, we’d love to see it.

If this is unreasonably difficult for you at the moment (for example if your recent work is under NDA, or if your current life situation makes it hard to spend the time) perhaps you can suggest an alternative way to show-case your way-of-working. Top reasons why you should join Hoxhunt - Impact. Cybersecurity is a “hot” industry. You get to design a product that defends companies from cybercrime, help support the cyber-skills training for 500.000+ everyday professionals, and make the world more cyber-secure. - Growth.

We have a cool office, but we also support remote working if you prefer (although we do think it’s important that you come to the office every now and then). Office hours are not set in stone. Getting the job done is what matters, not when or where it happens. xa0 Our Recruitment Process 1. Phone discussion with our Talent Acquisition team 2.

Here´s how we operate: https://www.steadily.com/culture/ ## What You’ll Do: * Combine property intelligence for external sources to estimate how likely a property is to flood, catch on fire, or get vandalized * Create a claim app that uses phone camera and sensors to document the damage smartly * Construct a mobile experience for people to buy insurance that is so simple/intuitive that your least-tech savvy relative with a flip-phone could use it without help e.g. pass the Mom Test * Build rating engines for calculating how much an insurance policy should cost ## What You´ll Bring: **Experienced**: This isn´t your first rodeo. There´s no specific minimum number of years requirement, but we expect you to be able to dive into a complex codebase without too much spin-up. Past experience as a team lead is definitely a plus. **Builder**: You like the product-side of engineering and have thoughtful opinions on what the user experience should be. You´re not the type of engineer who wants a fully-fleshed out spec thrown over the wall for you to code. **Pragmatic**: Let´s say you have a tradeoff to make: Option A is to ship something fast using an off-the-shelf API on AWS; you won´t learn that much and it only solves 80% of the problem, but it´ll only take a few days. Option B is to invest about two weeks building a new library and internally-hosted service that perfectly solves the problem; as a bonus you can share it on Github and give a presentation about it at PyCon. If you choose Option A 10/10 then you´ll be at home here. **Language-agnostic**: We don´t really care if you´ve worked in our stack before as long as you´re happy to learn it. If you´re sharp enough to be on this team, you´re sharp enough to learn any language or framework quickly. ## Our Stack: * Python 3 * Django * Postgres * Heroku (with full CI pipeline) * Redis / Celery * Kafka ## Compensation & Benefits: * Starting at $250,000 * Equity * 401K * Flexible Time Off * Health (HSA or FSA), vision, and dental insurance * Equipment provided ## Why Steadily? At Steadily you’ll be able to work with other brilliant, driven teammates who care about doing the best work of their lives. We have high expectations of each other, but are dedicated to supporting each other in those expectations and making Steadily a huge success. In order to do this, we believe in hiring top talent and encourage each team member to actively drive the culture we want at Steadily. This includes things like being light on processes where you manage your own workload. You know your job best, so we won’t micromanage how you get the job done (we provide context, not control)! That said, we’re also highly collaborative and go above and beyond to make sure that we’re all on the same page and have the tools we all need to succeed. Working at a startup isn’t easy, but it is incredibly rewarding. You’ll be able to see your actions directly impact the growth of the company, as well as your equity’s valuation, on a near-daily basis. The growth opportunity you’ll have at Steadily will also greatly increase your career trajectory, giving you valuable experience that you’d be hard pressed to find anywhere else. We’re excited to meet you! Be sure to mention the word **INVIGORATING** when applying to show you read the job post completely. This is a beta feature to avoid spam applicants.

Also an important part of the job is to interact with our designer to create pixel perfect UIs according to design specs. In this role you will be working as part of a small and highly effective cross functional team, where most developers have a full stack understanding of the technical challenges. As a main developer in the team, you will be part of all major technical decisions, shaping the best practices and creating new features for our product Bimsync by deploying code to production regularly. # What we are looking for We are looking for a passionate Full Stack Engineer that wants to own and help shape our web application for the construction industry. You should have a good understanding of web and backend technologies and the different challenges of creating web applications backed by REST APIs that are cloud native, having previously developed applications in the public cloud (AWS preferably). We expect a strong intimacy with JavaScript, as our application runs mainly in React, Redux and Typescript, and Java, as most of our backend stack is written in this language. We also look for proficient knowledge of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, to tune and shape the best data structures for each particular use case. Another important point is having familiarity with REST APIs and a good understanding of backwards compatibility for public APIs. The list above is quite comprehensive and can be intimidating, but we don’t expect you to be familiar with our whole tech stack coming in. That said, you need to have a willingness to learn as you go, as we believe in a growing and learning mindset, where developers are ready to face new challenges, and learn new technologies when needed. Thus, having the right skills and a positive attitude to learning, is more important for us than the degree. A BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related subject is relevant, as we value an understanding of the fundamentals, but it’s not a prerequisite. We define ourselves as an agile company, so being open for feedback and adapting to change is core to being a good fit to our team. Our company´s working language is English, in which we expect all candidates to effectively communicate (written and spoken). This position is open for fully remote, but has a requirement of being located in the EU. # What we offer You will be part of an amazing journey to transform the construction industry with a bold and caring team. Along this path, we will challenge each other, have difficult open conversations, and develop as we learn. In addition to the above, we will also take care of you and provide you with the right challenges for growth. Some of our benefits: * Paid time off (25 vacation days per year) * Flexible working hours * Full remote possible * Share options program * Company gatherings twice a year (in person) # Catenda Catenda is a Norwegian scale-up company with a global ambition to make the construction industry data-driven, with less waste and greater transparency along the way. Our company values are two, easy to remember: xa0**Openness** xa0and xa0**Quality**. We believe in open standards for all our customer data to achieve interoperability between applications, from inception, through design and construction onto the maintenance of a building. Another core belief is that our customers should have full control over their data: all data that goes in, can also be exported out. We value quality of the code and the product by working as a tight and effective distributed development team, preferably asynchronously, often sharing screens to collaborate. Catenda has offices in Oslo and Bergen, composed by an international team of 10+ nationalities working remotely across the EU. Our solution, Bimsync, is a cloud-based collaboration platform, consisting of a web application, a mobile application and our APIs. Many companies across the world are using our products to build better airports, hospitals, stadiums, homes and roads. Our technology stack runs 100% on AWS, using the most appropriate technology for the problem at hand. As mentioned before, our backend is mostly in Java and frontend in Javascript, using React, Typescript and React Native for our mobile app (iOS and Android).

I ´m David, one of the founders of Deedmob & CTO and who will be reviewing your application if you choose to apply . Let ´s get it straight out of the way: you would be Engineer #3 in a team of 6. Below you ´ll find detailed sections on what we think you should know about us before deciding to join us. Feel to skip to sections which interest you! >>>>>> The story of Deedmob so far My cofounder Boudewijn and I started Deedmob 4 years ago in Amsterdam to help connect young people with purpose in their careers, and help solve large social problems in the process. We set out to build a platform that would help charities engage our generation with flexible, impactful and enjoyable volunteering opportunities. We ´ve taken lots of twists and turns along the way, we ´ve learned a bunch and helped thousands of organizations spur volunteers into action. We have a small and effective team and believe in working smarter, not harder. We ´ve discovered it ´s incredible how much a small team of focused and capable individuals can accomplish through effective teamwork and communication. We don ´t have many meetings, and most of our work happens asynchronously (written) on Asana. Everyone is included and can see every discussion or decision they want to contribute to. Sometimes working at startups can be stressful and you can be expected to work unpaid overtime or on the weekends. That is not the case here at deedmob. You have the choice to work 4 days a week and work rarely extends beyond working hours. During the coronavirus crisis we shifted our work onto creating coronahelpers, a multi country volunteering initiative which helped thousands of at risk or ill people receive critical goods such as medicine and groceries. Our work resulted in mentions of deedmob and coronahelpers in dutch parliament, a conversation with the dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and the dutch queen Maxima. We were also honoured this year on Forbes ´ 30 under 30 social entrepreneurs list alongside Greta Thunberg. We are growing steadily and in the past we have raised money from venture capital investors. We are now focused on growing a stable, impactful and profitable social enterprise without additional external investment. >>>>>> The product We have a stable customer base of large companies like TomTom, Red Bull and H&M which use our software for corporate volunteering. The same product is also used by charities and local governments to engage people to volunteer. Our business model is SaaS (Software as a service) which means we charge customers per month to use our hosted solution. Our customers include Sanquin, the national dutch blood bank, large companies and local governments like Utrecht. Charities can use our platform to find volunteers for free, which is what you can see at deedmob.com. Our paid product allows organizations to create their own website with an inbuilt CRM, analytics and administrative data views into the platform. You can learn more about it at deedmobtools.com. Our product is one product with options to configure theme, pages and other settings per customer. We try to be pragmatic about product management and we ´ve learned our fair share. We were once a feature factory (See https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory(https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory)) but have learned our lesson since. We have a set of standard components we use to make interfaces and don ´t use a product designer for interface work, instead relying on our premade systems and the strengths of interface intuition of our team. A great resource for developing this skill is Refactoring UI (https://refactoringui.com/(https://refactoringui.com/)). This lets us get stuff done faster and with fewer people who need to understand the problem and solution. This comes with tradeoffs, and sometimes we do spend a longer time thinking about a particular problem from a product design perspective. >>>>>> What kind of technical work do we have upcoming? - 30% Making small adjustments to features or interface to make our product clearer or solve the customer ´s problems better, based on their feedback. Often it ´s little product changes that can add lots of value to customers. This often involves learning more about the customer ´s problem and clarifying their feedback with the product manager in order to come up with the best and simplest solution. - 20% Working on a new larger feature based on a customer problem we see across customers that is the biggest pain point. An example of such work on our roadmap is a file manager for the different files uploaded by an organisation in our tool. - 20% Fixing bugs. We have automated integration tests but sometimes there are visual issues or uncovered parts of the codebase where something goes wrong. We don ´t support IE or most annoying older browsers that would otherwise cause time consuming bugs. - 20% Adding a feature required for the launch of a new customer. This is almost always something that will also be useful for our existing customer base, but would have been a dealbreaker for this customer. - 10% DevOps/Deployments/Tech debt elimination >>>>>> About the role starts here **We think an ideal candidate would** - have the ability to ship solid code in React and Node (and Typescript, but you can learn that on the job) - understand how web apps work and have a basic understanding of deployments, browsers, servers etc. - acknowledge the challenges working in teams and believe that empathetic and effective communication is important - have an attitude of humbleness towards technology and the risks of creating problems from trying to solve problems too early (such as scaling, performance) - have a preference towards the simplest solution rather than the most technically interesting or most theoretically correct one - have pragmatism in being able to make decisions with incomplete information, and knowing when it ´s best to ask for clarification - have good personal time management skills - have good english communication skills - be able to help contribute to UI decisions for new features - have an attitude of learning and growth - be experienced with the challenges of remote work - have a feeling of responsibility for upholding product stability and quality - be empathetic and develop an understanding of our customer ´s problems **After the first 6 months we expect you to** - have shipped tasks making product roadmap progress and added value to customers - have helped upheld current technical stability and uptime - be communicating effectively in the team - be leading engineering decisions >>>>>> About the codebase starts here We started work on deedmob in 2016 with React + Redux + Node + REST + Postgres and Server side rendering. In 2019 we converted the entire codebase to Typescript as well as React functional components and hooks. In early 2020 we also added GraphQL for some endpoints. Here are some points about how we do things currently - We deploy to google cloud via Kubernetes & using cloud build so that one command can release a new version of the codebase. - We use github for git hosting. - We release approximately once every one to two weeks without a fixed schedule - We have automated integration tests in cypress for all important product flows. - We share lots of types and files between the frontend and the backend, as its all typescript! >>>>>> About remote work at deedmob We have experimented with a couple days remote for the last couple of years but more recently during the coronavirus crisis we gave up our beautiful office in Amsterdam in favour of full remote work. We have regular retreats to bring the team together in an epic location, and have had great times travelling together to Marrakech Morocco, Albufeira Portugal and Lisbon. The role is remote but we are currently open to candidates within 2 hours of our timezone (CET) in order to reduce any possible issues with meeting times and occasional synchronous collaboration. We have daily standups in morning and work without a specific methodology (like agile) currently as we have tried it and found it ´s not useful at our small team size. >>>>>> The interview process, roughly - 20 min call to assess fit - 40 minute live react coding call (no algorithms testing) - 3hr take home assignment - 30 minute technical call to discuss assignment submission with two engineers - 30 minute product call - 30 minute call with ceo offer >>>>>> About some of the people of deedmob Boudewijn Wijnands (CEO): A closer of deals. A fan of disney and dogs. Can always be bribed with chocolate or cake. https://www.linkedin.com/in/boudewijnwijnands/(https://www.linkedin.com/in/boudewijnwijnands/) David (CTO): It feels weird to write about myself here in the third person. I ´m interested in habits, personal development and product engineering. I try to live intentionally through a vegan diet and donating money via the ideas of effective altruism. I love puppies, playing football and cooking. https://twitter.com/davidvfurlong(https://twitter.com/davidvfurlong) Hendrik-Jan: A drummer, golfer and big fan of cuban cigars. Our resident adult as the oldest team member . Also called the Puppet Master for the strength of his network. https://www.linkedin.com/in/hendrik-jan-overmeer-ab957a6/(https://www.linkedin.com/in/hendrik-jan-overmeer-ab957a6/) Gerbrand Holland: Great writer. Recently started as a part time working student. >>>>>> Perks **Here are some of the perks of the job** - Impactful, purpose driven work (for instance our software has activated 20,000 new blood donors in the last 2 years) - Computer setup of your choice - Option for 4 days a week - Responsibility & the accompanying freedom and learning - Work from home (or from a co-working space) - Regular team retreats to sunny and fun locations - Core contribution into what we work on and how we solve a problem - Volunteering time off work - Low amount of time spent in meetings - Yearly budget for learning and development - Financial stability of the company (job security) - Low stress environment (low frequency of urgent issues or work) - Sizable equity compensation - Market rate salary compensation We think it ´s an incredible and rare opportunity for the right person. However we also know that there are great engineers like you that would be unhappy and not thrive in this role. In the interest of transparency and avoiding a mismatch, xa0**we think you should consider these reasons not to join us.** - There are fewer senior people to learn from and ask questions to than at a bigger company. Learning and career development is important to us but it will largely have to be self motivated and with external mentors or on the internet. We want to help you achieve your personal goals and will support you financially and structurally to achieve them. - We ´re growing, but the company is not growing in value or team size as fast as hyper funded startups. If you ´re hoping to get rich quick by joining a startup very early we would recommend choosing somewhere else. - If you need structure and someone to tell you what to work on, you will probably struggle with the autonomy and freedom you will have at Deedmob. A bigger company is probably a better choice. - If you want to work on a new project every couple of weeks, it ´s probably not a good fit. While the work is varied and changes, lots of the work is making improvements to our core product which some people don ´t like doing as much. That ´s fine. We know that building something great takes time and many of the greatest breakthroughs are small changes based on deep insights. We share less exciting work equally and try to reduce it by investing in changes or automating things. That being said, if you ´re easily bored and want constant new technical challenges it may not be the best role for you. Many of our challenges are product and technical challenges, so someone interested in being involved heavily in adding value to our customers through gaining a deeper problem understanding will thrive. - You should not join us if you want to work 60 hour weeks. We ´ve been there when we started out. We firmly believe it ´s not about how hard you work, but how good your decisions are about what to work on and how. Some people really like working all day. We ´d rather finish at 5 and spend time with our families or significant others. - If you think more features and complex technology is the best way to solve all problems, we probably have a different philosophy and it won ´t be a good fit. Technology is great and we strive to make great, pragmatic decisions but we see it as a means to solve customer problems. For us the most valuable work at the moment is usually creating great and often simple solutions learned from a deep product understanding rather than improving performance. - There ´s lots of code in our codebase that other people have written, and while there are docs, comments and we have eliminated technical debt on a rolling basis, understanding other ´s people code can be time consuming and not feel productive. We understand working on a new codebase can be more fun and more varied, and if that ´s very important to you, you probably shouldn ´t join us. We expect it will take you some time to learn how things work and we will support you in that process, but if in the past you find yourself wanting to work on something new and novel after 6 months we would recommend you to look for somewhere else. >>>>>> ⏬ TLDR; We ´re an awesome small team who have work-life balance and a purpose driven product.
